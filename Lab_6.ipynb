I\\'ve heard a number of different opinions on this and\\nhave still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if\\none wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors\\nunashamedly!) As to living by Christ\\'s example, we know very little about\\nJesus as a person.

I guess this is where\\nFaith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.\\n\\n>\\n>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no\\n>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.\\n\\nNo. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple\\nmoral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral\\ncode. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child\\nmay assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told\\nthe child that it is \"wrong\". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in\\nthe pub or bar (where there are no children). The \"wrongness\" here is if\\nthe child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is \"inappropriate\"\\nto swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of\\nanimals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that\\nhe is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but\\nyou get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive\\nas absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n',\n",

Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n',\n",

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent\\'s office on the way.  I asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe Celica (the \\'85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we\\'ll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it\\'s another story again - we\\'ll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens\\'t make sense.\"\\n \\n That\\'s what the book says.  We don\\'t insure Corvettes, either.  For\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\\\| |\\\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone\\'s entitled to MY opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\\\|\\\\  \\\\_|\\\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n======================================================================== 32\\n \\nI live in Idaho.

The 80 series Colt\\'s for\\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\\n\\n> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n>   operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nAgreed.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn\\'t cost you much.  On\\nthe other hand, I\\'ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\\nyears.  For example, I\\'ve had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\\n\\nI\\'ve had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.  There are all sorts\\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you\\'re out of the fight.\\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\\ninto that category.\\n\\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob\\'s \"The Semi\\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\\n\\nIn general, I\\'d agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\\n\\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\\nisn\\'t going to train them, they aren\\'t going to take the time on their\\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don\\'t bother.\\n\\nFor myself, I\\'d hate to be limited to one or the other.  I\\'d rather pick\\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I\\'m wearing that day\\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\\n\\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\\ntoo!)\\n\\nIf this post had gone the other way, I\\'d be arguing for revolvers. :-)\\n\\nRick.\\n',\n",

Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\\nand giving up 6.6/game. \\n\\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \\nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\\nis a big question mark.\\n\\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

JPL has developed a backup plan using data\\n    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from\\n    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve\\n    approximately 70% of its original objectives.\\n\\n\\t   Galileo Schedule\\n\\t   ----------------\\n\\t   10/18/89 - Launch from Space Shuttle\\n\\t   02/09/90 - Venus Flyby\\n\\t   10/**/90 - Venus Data Playback\\n\\t   12/08/90 - 1st Earth Flyby\\n\\t   05/01/91 - High Gain Antenna Unfurled\\n\\t   07/91 - 06/92 - 1st Asteroid Belt Passage\\n\\t   10/29/91 - Asteroid Gaspra Flyby\\n\\t   12/08/92 - 2nd Earth Flyby\\n\\t   05/93 - 11/93 - 2nd Asteroid Belt Passage\\n\\t   08/28/93 - Asteroid Ida Flyby\\n\\t   07/02/95 - Probe Separation\\n\\t   07/09/95 - Orbiter Deflection Maneuver\\n\\t   12/95 - 10/97 - Orbital Tour of Jovian Moons\\n\\t   12/07/95 - Jupiter/Io Encounter\\n\\t   07/18/96 - Ganymede\\n\\t   09/28/96 - Ganymede\\n\\t   12/12/96 - Callisto\\n\\t   01/23/97 - Europa\\n\\t   02/28/97 - Ganymede\\n\\t   04/22/97 - Europa\\n\\t   05/31/97 - Europa\\n\\t   10/05/97 - Jupiter Magnetotail Exploration\\n\\n\\n    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90.

The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see\\n    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992).

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for\\nother reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy\\nand peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were\\nkilled when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions \\nlying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice,\\npeaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to\\nmind...\\n\\nI agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers\\nof people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally\\nintended for.\\n\\nThat doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is\\njust a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in\\nthe Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in\\nreligious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many\\npeople have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own\\nstomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to\\nkill by their leaders.\\n\\nThe point is that there are many things involved in religion that often\\nlead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \\n\\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\\nparts of Man's history.@\\n\\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\\n\\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\\n\\n-ciao\\n\\n-chris blask\\n\",\n",

In 1941, \\nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \\ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \\nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \\ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \\ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \\nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \\nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \\nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \\nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler\\'s policy of \\nextermination of the Jews.\\n\\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\\n\\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \\n\\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \\nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \\nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \\nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \\nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide.

It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate\\nlong before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no\\nprecedent in the Qur\\'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly\\nlevelling death penalties for apostasy.\\n\\nI believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of \"fasad\". This\\nruling applies both within and outside the domain of an\\nIslamic state and it can be carried out by individuals.

However, the charge of \"fasad\" can encompass a\\nnumber of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations\\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the\\n\"crisis\". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not\\nthe main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are\\nlevelled at people, not books.\\n\\nThe Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the\\nissuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz,\\npresenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of\\nsecular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. \\nFanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost\\nhis image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then\\nMuslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while\\nprotesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily\\nconcerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again\\nattack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this\\npoint that the fatwa on \"fasad\" was issued.\\n\\nThe fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of\\nRushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of\\nthe ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant\\nwill of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa\\nagainst the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The\\ncrime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being\\nplayed out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.\\n\\nP.S. I\\'m not sure about this but I think the charge of \"shatim\" also\\napplies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella\\nof the \"fasad\" ruling.\\n',\n",

I don\\'t think it is the\\nfunction overloading at all-- I do that sort of thing all of the time\\nin BC++ without a hitch.  The big problems I have encountered in\\nporting MFC to BC++ is that fact that MFC _depends_ on a couple of\\ninvalid C++ assumptions.\\n\\nI have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under BC++, but\\nthe reason is that MS makes some bad assumptions about the order in\\nwhich static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are\\ngetting accessed before they are initialized).  The problem is in the\\nowner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all\\nother pieces of ctrltest work fine.\\n\\nTwo other major gotchas I have found using MFC under BC++:\\n\\n- The CFile::OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,\\n  rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ\\n  between MSC and BC).\\n\\n- All of the MFC collection classes depend on another bad C++\\n  assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place\\n  of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, NOT for\\n  references).\\n\\nI am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but I have\\nnot encountered them (yet).  I have not seen MFC 2.0 yet, but I hope\\nthat some of these will be addressed.  If they are not, all of MS\\'s\\nhype about portability to other vendor\\'s compilers will be just that.\\n\\n-- \\n      If these were my employer\\'s opinions, I wouldn\\'t be posting them.\\n###############################################################################\\n  \"Whoever said nothing lasts forever was obviously  # R.

It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \\nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro.

What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)?

The many\\nverses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been\\nshoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)\\nChristians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion\\nof any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well\\nas a disproof of the opposing view.

From all accounts I\\'ve\\nheard practically no one steals BMWs. Probably it is similar for Moto\\nGuzzis and other relative \"exotics\" since there isn\\'t a large demand\\nfor parts and the bike would be much easier to track down.

And all for making a quick\\nbuck.  I would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the U.S. is\\nsignificantly inflated by these \"quacks of a different color\".  In fact, I\\'d\\nsay these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the\\ntrue focus of the medical profession.  The AMA and the Boards should focus\\non these \"quacks\" instead of devoting unbelievable energy on \\'search-and-\\ndestroy-missions\\' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non-\\ntraditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients\\nthat traditional/accepted medicine cannot help.\\n\\n\\n***************************************************\\nNow to make a general comment on many recent posts:\\n***************************************************\\n\\nLately I\\'ve seen the word \"quack\" bandied about recklessly.  When a doctor or\\ndoctor-wanna-be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical\\nsubject in a civilized manner, all he/she has to do is say \"quack-quack\" and\\nsomehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over\\non their backs and pee-pee on themselves in obedience.  What do they teach\\nyou in medical school - how to throw your authority around?\\n\\nLet me put it another way to make my point clear:  \"quack\" is a nebulous word\\nlacking in any precision.  Its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.\\nThe indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency;  and coming\\nfrom any medical doctor (or wanna-be), where competency is expected, is real\\nscary.\\n\\nBut what do I know, I\\'ve already been diagnosed by the sci.med.gods in this\\nnewsgroup as being \\'anal retentive\\', and \\'psychotic\\'.

Hey, they\\'re free.\\n\\n\\nJon \"Quacks \\'R Us\" Noring\\n\\n\\n(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on\\nthe net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and\\ntheories, such as the \"yeast theory\", should create your own moderated group.\\nYou can call it sci.med.traditional.moderated or sci.med.AMA-approved, so you\\ncan keep anal-retentives like me out of it.)\\n\\n-- \\n\\nCharter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.\\n\\nIf you\\'re dying to know what INFJ means, be brave, e-mail me, I\\'ll send info.\\n=============================================================================\\n| Jon Noring          | noring@netcom.com        |                          |\\n| JKN International   | IP    : 192.100.81.100   | FRED\\'S GOURMET CHOCOLATE |\\n| 1312 Carlton Place  | Phone : (510) 294-8153   | CHIPS - World\\'s Best!    |\\n| Livermore, CA 94550 | V-Mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |\\n=============================================================================\\nWho are you?

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\\n\\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\\n    frequently.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\\n\\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\\n\\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\\n    says:\\n\\n\\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

What Peter says about God is what\\nthe Bible says.   \\n\\n\\nConsider the Bible a court recording.

No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony\\ndares to venture off what is already known.

You will see the floppy disk and\\n    hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. Follow the usual anti-static\\n    precautions and of course make sure the machine is OFF when you do\\n    this. Unplug the wall and monitor power supply cords from the back\\n\\tof the mac.\\n \\n3)  Remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the\\n    tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.\\n    The tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the\\n    tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. You may\\n    also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power\\n    supply. Leave that alone. The plastic tab from the tower is all you\\n    need release.\\n \\n4)  Look at the rear of the tower assembly. You will see the flat ribbon\\n    SCSI connector to the hard drive, a power cable and a flat ribbon cable\\n    leading to the floppy drive. Disconnect all these from the motherboard.\\n    The hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed\\n    to release it.\\n                                            \\n5)  Unplug the drive activity LED from its clear plastic mount\\n\\n6)  Look down the posterior, cylindrical section of the plastic tower. A\\n    phillips head screw is at the base. Remove it, taking care not to drop\\n    it into the case. A bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful\\n    here.\\n\\n7)  Remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the\\n    right side of the tower. This tab prevents the tower from sliding\\n\\tposteriorly. Slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then\\n\\tlift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.\\n\\n8)  Congratulations, you have now gained access to your machine's SIMM\\n    slots.\\n\\n9)  The six big slots are for VRAM. One usually must install all six to\\n    gain useful video modes. All SIMMS (RAM or VRAM)  installed with their\\n\\tchips facing the front of the motherboard.\\n\\t\\n    The four smaller sockets in front are for RAM SIMMS. Install SIMMS in\\n\\tsets of four into these sockets. Be sure you seat the SIMMS squarely\\n\\tand firmly into a fully upright position.\\n\\t\\n10) Reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the\\n    tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about\\n\\t1 cm posterior of its intended position. Lower the tower assembly into\\n\\tplace while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.\\n    Once fully down, slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks\\n    into place.\\n\\t\\n11) Reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. DONT'T FORGET THE FLOPPY\\n    DRIVE CABLE.\\n\\n12) Replace the phillips head screw\\n\\n13) Drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.\\n\\n14) Plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount\\n\\nGuy Kuo <guykuo@u.washington.edu>\\n\\n\",\n",

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and\\nyou have a mixer!\\n\\nLots of luck!\\n-- \\n73, Tom\\n================================================================================\\nTom Wagner, Audio Visual Technician.

But if you\\'re a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn\\'t see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn\\'t tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout.

It is the fundamental premis \"A is not not-A\". If a thing\\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \\nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \\nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \\nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \\nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\\nbelief is of the strong kind.

Saying that the glass \\nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\\n \\nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \\nsame belief in different words.

Great\\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\\nagreement in belief.

This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn\\'t  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\\nEvangelical Churches.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\\nMonophysitism.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    \\'-------------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n\\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\\nheretical probably aren\\'t.\\n\\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\\nrejected who didn\\'t intend heresy, but simply used language that was\\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\\nthe Antiochene tradition.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

But this\\nstrategy wouldn\\'t get the stuff admitted in court.  (At least, not\\nin the near term.)\\n\\nIn other words, near as I can tell, the thing that makes such evidence\\ninadmissable is the interception without a warrant, not the attempt to\\ninterpret what was intercepted without a warrant.  I\\'d be surprised\\nthat archiving data without consent would be interpreted as anything\\nbut analogous to a wiretap by the courts.\\n\\nNote that that doesn\\'t mean I think it won\\'t be done if technically\\nfeasible.  Just as I\\'m sure many wiretaps are done now without\\nwarrants, just to fish for avenues to investigate.  So in the future,\\nstart surveilance, start archiving data, trump up some probable cause,\\ndecrypt post-facto after the warrant is in hand, and the investigation\\ngets a boost from data that, sadly, won\\'t ever be presented to a jury.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m posting...  for an interesting cautionary tale projecting this\\narchiving scenario to extremes, read \"Lacey and his Friends\", a\\ncollection of sf stories by David Drake.  The US starts down the\\nslippery slope by archiving *everyghing*.  But don\\'t worry folks, it\\'s\\nstored in a secure repository where nobody but LEAs with warrants can\\nget to it.  And by the way, we\\'ll be installing cameras on all major\\nstreets.  Hey, this is nothing new, we already have cameras in banks and\\nteller machines, don\\'t we?\\n\\nAnd then we\\'ll pass laws requiring cameras covering *all* public\\nplaces.  Then in some private places.  Then we\\'ll make it a crime ever\\nto be out of range of a camera, except in legally licensed privacy\\ncubicles.  Only alone.  And with a thorough body search before and\\nafter.  But, see, there\\'s still a right to privacy.  We haven\\'t\\ncurtailed any rights, not really.  And just think how much easier it\\'d\\nbe to solve crimes in such a situation: just obtain a warrant, put on a\\nVR helmet and take a walk down memory lane.\\n\\nAnd hey, nobody\\'ll be tracking *you* or *me*, no need to be self-conscious.\\n\\nAfter all, if you\\'re not doing anything illegal...\\n\\nFunny, though.

The Orthodox have said that\\n>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but\\n>it is not \"in use.\"\\n\\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\\n\\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\\nCreed (it wasn\\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\\n\\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\\nbelow)\\n\\n\\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\\nthrough the Son\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being necessary.\\n\\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\\nposition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\\'; and again it\\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\\nis none of His.\\'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\\' and that `He shall\\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\\'\"\\n\\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\\nFather,\\' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\\' and `will\\nreceive of mine,\\' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\\n\\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\\nis the Spirit created.\"\\n\\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\\nit is not possible for me to be silent.

I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.

The\\ncommunity provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are\\ninvolved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of\\ntheir commitment as possible.

Where I\\'m not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in\\nexceptional cases (\"valid but irregular\").  Ne Temere (1907) says that\\nno marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according\\nto the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new\\ncanon law retains this, but I\\'d rather see a more recent and\\nauthoritative source.

It should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at\\n65 MHz, which would mean detecting a 15 NS pulse.  It should also be\\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\\ncheap.  \\n\\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\\n\\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\\ncircuit would not detect it.   \\n\\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\\nvideo signals to make this work.  \\n\\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \\nsplit supplies.

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tJohn.\\n\",\n",

Metzger)\\nSubject: The Escrow Database.\\nOrganization: Partnership for an America Free Drug\\nLines: 77\\n\\nHere is a disturbing thought.\\n\\nNow, we no longer live in the days of big filing cabinets. We live in\\nthe electronic age. I asked myself, how big could the escrow database\\nget? How hard might it be to steal the whole thing, particularly were\\nI an NSA official operating with the tacit permission of the escrow\\nhouses? (We can pretend that such will not happen, but thats naive.)\\n\\nWell, lets see. Ten bytes of each escrow half. Lets asume ten bytes of\\nserial number -- in fact, I believe the serial number is smaller, but\\nthis is an order of magnitude calculation. We assume 250*10^6 as the\\npopulation, and that each person has a key. I get five gigabytes for\\neach of the two escrow databases. Fits conveniently on a single very\\nvaluable Exabyte tape. This can only get easier with time, but who\\ncares -- I can already hold all the clipper keys in the country in my\\npocket on two 8mm tapes.\\n\\nAdmittely, they will think of safeguards. They won\\'t put the whole\\ndatabase on one disk, prehaps. Maybe they will throw stumbling blocks\\nin the way. This changes nothing -- they keys will be needed every day\\nby hundreds if not thousands of law enforcement types, so convenience\\nwill dictate that the system permit quick electronic retrieval. At\\nsome point, with or without collusion by the agencies, those exabyte\\ntapes are going to get cut. Dorothy Denning and David Sternlight will\\ndoubtless claim this can\\'t happen -- but we know that \"can\\'t\" is a\\nprayer, not a word that in this instance connotes realism.\\n\\nWith two exabyte tapes in your pocket, you would hold the keys for\\nevery person\\'s conversations in the country in your hands. Yeah, you\\nneed the \"master key\" two -- but thats just ten bytes of information\\nthat have to be stored an awful lot of places.\\n\\nCome to think of it, even if the NSA getting a copy of the database\\nisn\\'t a threat to you because unlike me you have no contraversial\\npolitical views, consider foreign intelligence services. You know, the\\nones that David Sternlight wants to protect us from because of the\\nevil industrial espionage that they do. The French apparently do have\\na big spying operation in friendly countries to get industrial\\nsecrets, so he isn\\'t being completely irrational here (although why\\nour companies couldn\\'t use cryptosystems without back doors is left\\nunexplained by those that point out this threat.) \\n\\nPresumably, foreign intelligence services can get moles into the NSA\\nand other agencies. We have proof by example of this: its happened\\nmany times. Presumably, someday they will get their hands on some\\nfraction of the keys. You can\\'t avoid that sort of thing.\\n\\nDon\\'t pretend that no one unauthorized will ever get their hands on\\nthe escrow databases.\\n\\nWe crypto types are all taught something very important at the\\nbeginning of intro to cryptography -- security must depend on the\\neasily changed key that you pick to run your system, and not on a\\nsecret. The escrow databases aren\\'t the sorts of secrets that our\\nteachers told us about, but they are the sort of big secrets they\\nwould lump into this category. Imagine trying to replace 100 million\\nClipper chips.\\n\\nI cannot believe that the NSA or whomever it is thats doing this\\ndoesn\\'t realize all this already. They are too smart. There are too\\nmany of them who have made their bones in the real world. I suspect\\nthat they know precisely what they are doing -- and that what they are\\ndoing is giving us the appearance of safety so that they can continue\\nto surveil in spite of the growth of strong cryptography. I suspect\\nthat they realize that they can\\'t put things off forever, but they can\\ntry to delay things as long as possible.\\n\\nWho knows. Maybe even some of the higher ups, the inevitable\\nbureaucratic types that rise in any organization, really do believe\\nthat this scheme might give people some security, even as their\\nsubordinates in Fort Meade wring their hands over the foolishness of\\nit all.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com\\n--\\nLaissez faire, laissez passer.

When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, \\nwait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the\\npuncture, and of course, that doesn\\'t feel good.  A way to prevent\\nirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to\\ndo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the \\nspot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,\\nand spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \" apart.)\\n\\nThis is from experience, so I hope it\\'ll help you.

I\\'m not\\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\\nit\\'s possible to see these passages in different ways.  It\\'s possible\\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\\nthere\\'s a wide enough variety of images that it\\'s possible to\\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\\nimplies that the damned don\\'t get resurrected at all.  Presumably\\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I\\'m aware that it\\'s possible to \\nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\\n\\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn\\'t eternal punishement.\\n\\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\\neternal doesn\\'t mean that people will last in its flames forever.\\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\\nthe devil, and humans?\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\\nunderstood either way, but I think it\\'s at least possible to think\\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\\neternity.\\n\\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\\nit doesn\\'t explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \\nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn\\'t say that the people\\nare tormented forever.\\n\\nPsalm 9:17:  I don\\'t see that it says anything relevant to this issue.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

UK.\\nSupersedes: <19930322114724@mantis.co.uk>\\nLines: 632\\n\\nArchive-name: atheism/logic\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.4\\n\\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\\n\\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"\\n\\nÿ\\n',\n",

But that is\\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\\nrather be playing golf, don\\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\\'t say this\\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\\ndon\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\\nhuman attitudes.  \\n\\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \\nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \\ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\\na decent living. \\n\\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \\nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\\n\\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \\nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \\nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\\nleague over the year.

Polymenakos) writes:\\n\\n> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing\\n>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in\\n>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks of\\n\\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \\nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1. The train going from Denizli to Smyrna was stopped at Ephesus\\n   and the 90 Turkish travellers, men and women who were in it ordered\\n   to descend. And there in the open street, under the eyes of their\\n   husbands, fathers and brothers, the women without distinction of age\\n   were violated, and then all the travellers were massacred. Amongst\\n   the latter the Lieutenant Salih Effendi, a native of Tripoli, and a\\n   captain whose name is not known, and to whom the Hellenic authorities\\n   had given safe conduct, were killed with specially atrocious tortures.\\n\\n   2. Before the battle, the wife of the lawyer Enver Bey coming from\\n   her garden was maltreated by Greek soldiers, she was even stript\\n   of her garments and her servant Assie was violated.\\n\\n   3.

During the firing of the town, eleven children, six little girls\\n   and five boys, fleeing from the flames, were stopped by Greek soldiers\\n   in the Ramazan Pacha quarter, and thrown into a burning Jewish house\\n   near bridge, where they were burnt alive. This fact is confirmed on oath\\n   by the retired commandant Hussein Hussni Effendi who saw it.\\n\\n   5. The clock-maker Ahmed Effendi and his son Sadi were arrested and\\n   dragged out of their shop. The son had his eyes put out and was then\\n   killed in the court of the Greek Church, but Ahmed Effendi has been\\n   no more heard of.\\n\\n   6.

Tavares)\\nSubject: Re: [long]: Gun Hearings Day in Massachusetts (April 7)\\nOrganization: Stratus Computer, Inc.\\nLines: 263\\nDistribution: usa\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: rocket.sw.stratus.com\\n\\n[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\\n\\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\\n\\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\\n\\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\\nmany cases, who they were).\\n\\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\\'t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\\ndelegation of students from Simon\\'s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\\n\\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\\'s\\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\\ninadequate hearing room.\\n\\nOne of my representatives\\' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"Everyone\\'s out of step but Johnny!\"\\n\\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\\nGOAL\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\\n\\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\\n\\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nAgain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\\nended at about 6:30.\\n-- \\n\\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\\' Packet...\\n\\n',\n",

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\\n\\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\\nTruth.\\n\\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\\n\\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\\n\\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\\n\\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\\'s go back to our shorthand method of doing\\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\\n\\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\\n\\n B: How do you know?\\n\\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\\n\\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\\n\\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\\n\\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\\'t mean it is\\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\\n\\n A: ...\\n\\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\\ncan\\'t prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\\n\\nThere is no way out of the loop.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\\n\\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\\n\\n *\\n\\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\\nknowably Inerrant.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded.\"\\n                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein\\n',\n",

Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.

At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\\n\\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can\\'t wear out       |\\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\\n| \\'88 K75S  \\'48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\\n| \\'75 R90S(#151) \\'72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They\\'re built like rocks |\\n| \\'65 R50/2/Velorex  \\'57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It\\'s the Harleys that     |\\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Rather, I was trying to show the absurdity of atheistic materialist\\n>relatavists trying to embrace some common moral system as though it were\\n>absolute.  Man knows in his heart that there is right and wrong.  We have\\n>all inherited this knowledge.  \\n\\nNo matter how \"absurd\" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by\\nmankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common\\nmoral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:\\n\\n\"Oh, where is the sea?\", the fishes cried,\\nAs they swam its clearness through.\\n\\n',\n",

The problem occurs when you click on the Turbo Debugger\\n   icon (or use the Debugger option in the Run command), and the\\n   debugger application goes to VGA character mode (as it is designed\\n   to do).

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)

Johnson Space Center\\n    Houston, Texas\\n\\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\\n    ==================================================================\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ---------------------------\\n\\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1.

When NASA\\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\n\\n    Active Duty Military\\n\\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\\n    specified tour of duty.\\n\\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\n\\n    Pay and Benefits\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Civilians\\n\\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\n    and experience.\\n\\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\n\\n    Military\\n\\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\n    other similar military matters.\\n\\n\\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\\n',\n",

The Jews of Jesus\\'s time believed that all sickness was the\\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \\ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\\n>\\n>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.\\n>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?\\n>I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\\'ve missed the mark\\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \\nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\\n\\nIn case you couldn\\'t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\\nno more and no less than we do.  I\\'ve said this before, but I think\\nit\\'s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \\nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn\\'t what I would want it to be,\\nbut God\\'s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\\nweight (she\\'s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\\nher improvement in her health to God\\'s intervention in her life.  Who\\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\\n\\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \\nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\\n(or something like that).\\n\\nMay we all experience and accept God\\'s grace.\\n>\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed\\n>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not\\n>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies\\n>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nPaul Conditt\\t\\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\\nApplied Research\\tPhone:\\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\\n  Laboratories\\t\\tFedex:\\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\\nUniversity of Texas\\tPostal:\\t  P.O.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov District. That\\'s in Azerbaijan, near the\\nNagorno Karabagh region.\\n\\nAfter the 14th, rumors started to the effect that in Karabagh, specifically\\nin Stepanakert, an uprising had taken place. They said \"uprising\" in\\nAzerbaijani, but I don\\'t think it was really an uprising, just a \\ndemonstration. After that the unrest started. Several Armenians living in the \\nZhdanov District were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \\nwomen; it was said that they were at the demonstrations, but they live here, \\nand went from here to Karabagh to demonstrate. After that I felt uneasy. There\\nwere some conversations about Armenians among the local population: the\\nArmenians had done this, the Armenians had done that. Right there at the site.\\nI was attacked a couple of times by kids. Well true, the guys from my crew \\nwouldn\\'t let them come at me with cables and knives. After that I felt really \\nbad. I didn\\'t know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\\n\"There\\'s unrest everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\\nthe Second Secretary of the District Party Committee what had been going on \\nand said I wanted to take my crew off the site. They wouldn\\'t allow it, they \\nsaid, \"Nothing\\'s going to happen to you, we\\'ve entrusted the matter to the \\npolice, we\\'ve warned everyone in the district, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nWell, in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me, he \\nknows all the local people and would protect me if something happened. This\\nman didn\\'t leave me alone for five minutes: he was at work the whole time and \\nafterward he spent the night with us, too.\\n\\nI sense some disquiet and call home; my wife also tells me, \"The situation is\\nvery tense, be careful.\"\\n\\nWe finished the job at the site, and I left for Sumgait first thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guys warned me, they told me that I\\nshouldn\\'t tell anyone on the way that I was an Armenian. I took someone else\\'s\\nbusiness travel documents, in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \\nand my passport in my socks. We set out for Baku. Our guys were on the bus, \\nthey sat behind, and I sat up front. In Baku they had come to me and said that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel documents just in case. As it turns out \\nthey knew what was happening in Sumgait.\\n\\nI arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait is\\nclosed, there is no way to get there. That the city is closed off and the \\nbuses aren\\'t running. Buses normally leave Baku for Sumgait almost every two\\nminutes. And suddenly--no buses. Well, we tried to get there via private\\ndrivers. One man, an Azerbaijani, said, \"Let\\'s go find some other way to get\\nthere.\" They found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake us to Sumgait.\\n\\nHe took us there. But the others had said, \"I wouldn\\'t go if you gave me a\\nthousand rubles.\" \"Why?\" \"Because they\\'re burning the city and killing the\\nArmenians. There isn\\'t an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of myself so I could\\nstill stand up. So we squared it away, the four of us got in the car, and we \\nset off for Sumgait. On the way the driver says, \"In fact there aren\\'t any\\nArmenians left. \\'They burned them all, beat them all, and stabbed them.\" Well \\nI was silent. The whole way--20-odd miles--I was silent. The driver asks me, \\n\"How old are you, old man?\" He wants to know: if I\\'m being that quiet, not \\nsaying anything, maybe it means I\\'m an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he asks \\nme. I say, \"I\\'m 47.\" \"I\\'m 47 too, but I call you \\'old man\\'.\" I say, \"It \\ndepends on God, each person\\'s life in this world is different.\" I look much\\nolder than my years, that\\'s why he called me old man. Well after that he was\\nsilent, too.\\n\\nWe\\'re approaching the city, I look and see tanks all around, and a cordon.\\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand. Well, he\\nwas waving his hand, we all start waving our hands. I\\'m sitting there with\\nthem, I start waving my hand, too. I realized that this was a sign that meant\\nthere were no Armenians with us.\\n\\nI look at the city--there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\nstreet, you know, and there\\'s no traffic. Well probably I was scared. They\\nstopped our car. People were standing on the sidewalks. They have armature \\nshafts, and stones . . . And they stopped us . . .\\n\\nAlong the way the driver tells us how they know who\\'s an Armenian and who\\'s \\nnot. The Armenians usually . . . For example, I\\'m an Armenian, but I speak \\ntheir language very well. Well Armenians usually pronounce the Azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" as \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" is actually correct. The \\npronunciations are different. Anyone who says \"pundukh,\" even if they\\'re not \\nArmenian, they immediately take out and start to slash. Another one says, \\n\"There was a car there, with five people inside it,\" he says. \"They started \\nhitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didn\\'t let the\\npeople out,\" he says, \"they wouldn\\'t let them get out of the car.\" I only saw \\nthe car, but the driver says that he saw everything. Well he often drives from\\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nWhen they stop us we all get out of the car. I look and there\\'s a short guy,\\nhis eyes are gleaming, he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in\\nthe other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one. \"We\\'re\\nAzerbaijani,\\' they tell him, \\'no Armenians here.\" He did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our things out and says, \"Maybe you\\'re an Armenian, old man?\" \\nBut in Azerbaijani I say, \"You should be ashamed of yourself!\" And . . . he \\nleft. Turned and left. That was all that happened. What was I to do? I had \\nto . . . the city was on fire, but I had to steal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nThey stopped us at the entrance to Mir Street, that\\'s where the Kavkaz store \\nand three large, 12-story buildings are. That\\'s the beginning of down-town. I \\nsaw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \\ncouldn\\'t figure out if it was a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhets. Later I was told it \\nwas a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \\nremained of them, not even any traces. That driver had told me about it, and I\\nsaw the car myself. The car was there. The skeleton, a metallic carcass. About\\n30 to 40 yards from the Kavkaz store.\\n\\nI see a military transport, an armored personnel carrier. The hatches are\\nclosed. And people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it, the\\ncrowd is. And I hear shots, not automatic fire, it\\'s true, but pistol shots.\\nSeveral shots. There were Azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier. \\nSomeone in the crowd was shooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \\nsoldiers or get a machine gun or something. At that point there was only one \\narmored personnel carrier. And all the tanks were outside the city, cordoning \\noff Sumgait.\\n\\nI walked on. I see two Azerbaijanis going home from the plant. I can tell by \\ntheir gait that they\\'re not bandits, they\\'re just people, walking home. I\\njoined them so in case something happened, in case someone came up to us\\nand asked questions, either of us would be in a position to answer, you see.\\nBut I avoided the large groups because I\\'m a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. I tried to keep at a distance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. Well so I walked into Microdistrict 2, which is across from our block.\\nI can\\'t get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people, so as \\nto get around. Well there I see a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. And he\\'s shouting into a megaphone: \"Comrades, the Armenian-\\nAzerbaijani war has begun!\"\\n\\nThe police have megaphones like that. So they\\'re talking and walking around \\nthe second microdistrict. I see that they\\'re coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building. I noticed that they walked around the outside buildings, \\nand inside the microdistricts there were about 5 or 6 people standing on every\\ncorner, and at the middles of the buildings, and at the edges. What they were \\ndoing I can\\'t say, because I couldn\\'t get up close to them, I was afraid. But \\nthe most important thing was to get away from there, to get home, and at least\\nfind out if my children were alive or not . . .\\n\\n   April 20, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Our Lutheran parish just\\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \\na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.

Our pastor does have control of this committee\\nbut listens very carefully to the committee\\'s suggestions.  It needs a strong\\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.

AKA \"wishy-washy\".\\n \\nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.

It\\'s not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\\nis Not there.\\n\\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.

I have only ever met one who wouldn\\'t listen.  They are there to \\nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.

The magnitude of such accelerations he\\nestimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not\\nbe a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published\\nin 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g.

Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \\nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\\n \\n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\\n\\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\\na LOT of trouble with order.

Very few.

God may choose one individual over\\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\\n\\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\\n\\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\\nrefute the disciples\\' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChrist\\'s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\\n\\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\\nthe Baptist,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\\n\\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner\\'s (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing\\'s \"The\\nEducation of the Human Race\".\\n\\nTo return to your original point, Paul\\'s statement about Jacob and\\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\\nChrist, in my view.\\n\\nRegards, \\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already.

As a result, He knew every\\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.

No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew &\\nGentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those\\nwho would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus\\'s\\ndismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.

I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\\n\\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\\n\\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\\n\\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\\nWhite cause.\"\\n\\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\\n\\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\\nWeaver otherwise.\\n\\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\\nWeaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'s\\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\\n\\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife\\'s voice on the tape.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\\nHarris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.\\n\\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \\nKenneth Fadeley\\'s testimony is scheduled to continue. \\n\\n',\n",

For example, there are a few chaps who are \\ntrying to prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old, and that the\\nerror in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed \\nlight has been rapidly decaying over the years, and this has not been \\naccounted for. :-] )\\n\\n>\\tThe book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a \\n>modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.\\n\\nOr (of course), that he never existed, and the bible was a story, and was never \\nintended to become a manifesto for a billion people.  Did Tony follow that one\\nup?\\n\\n>\\tSome reasons why he wouldn\\'t be a liar are as follows.  Who would \\n>die for a lie?  Wouldn\\'t people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People \\n>gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing \\n>someone who was or had been healed.  \\n\\nMillions of people have \"died for a lie\".  This  point is difficult to \\nsubstantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments\\nwork in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed \\nthemselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory\\nof the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.\\n\\n>Call me a fool, but I believe he did heal people.\\n  \\nThat is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone)\\nto become a christian.  More to the point, it does not add weight to\\nthe claim that Jesus was the \"real thing\".\\n\\n\\n>\\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn \\n>to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example \\n>anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \\n>this right away.\\n\\nHave you ever seen a documentary about the rise of Nazi Germany?  More to the\\npoint, did Tony mention this?  One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and his\\nmany colleagues  fools, or  illogical men, their support of Hitler was based \\n(I presume) upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with \\nhis principles.  Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler\\nwas sane....\\n\\n \\n\\n>\\tTherefore since he wasn\\'t a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \\n>real thing.  \\n\\nHmmm.... I don\\'t think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\"\\n\\n>\\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \\n>the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \\n>and Crucifixion.  I don\\'t have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \\n>write I will use it.\\n\\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\\npeople result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think\\npeople can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of\\nmetaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to\\npresent.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or\\nshe will end up in all sorts of shit.   \\n\\nTony\\'s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe\\nthe events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, \\nwho thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the\\nbook is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say \"a is\\nequal to b because a is equal to b\".\\n\\n  \\n\\n>\\tI don\\'t think most people understand what a Christian is.  \\n\\nThat would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed \\nin religious wars, and why there are hundreds of different versions all\\nclaiming to be correct.  \\n\\nIt \\n>is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \\n>should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God\\'s \\n>sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \\n>same.

A person from Jesus\\' culture authorized\\nto conduct business \"in John\\'s name\" had full authority over John\\'s\\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\\nwork only for John\\'s benefit and consonant with John\\'s wishes.  It was\\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\\n\"in John\\'s name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\\n\\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" does not\\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus\\' name\" is not only\\npresent but prominent in the Lord\\'s Prayer, although the verbal\\nforumula is absent.\\n\\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus\\' Name\" may be beneficial if\\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\\nadvancement of God\\'s Kingdom.  For that reason, I\\'m not quite ready\\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\\n\\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\\netc.) don\\'t seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D.

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

Div of Field Epidemiology, Epidemiology Program Office; Enteric \\nDiseases Br, Div of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for \\nInfectious Diseases, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: E. coli O157:H7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first \\nidentified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody \\ndiarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I\\'ll\\ntry to get better.\\n\\nRob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle\\napproach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,\\nonly responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both\\ncases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse\\nfor myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.\\n\\nRob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. \\nvasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is\\nan excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  \\nI think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with\\nhis set of excuses.  \\n\\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants\\nto know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses\\nwhich have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\\nBible for himself and come to his own decisions without being\\nsidetracked with the temptation to mock God.\\n\\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\\nstanding out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \\nsee a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away\\nfrom the oncoming truck.  He doesn\\'t see it.   Here\\'s is how I see\\nthe dialog:\\n\\n\\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \\n\\nBK:  \"There is no truck.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\\n     the oncoming truck.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why trucks exist.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. I won\\'t because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing\\n      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.\"\\n      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.\\n\\nBK:  \"It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.\\n      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.\"\\n      And by the way, I really have an open mind.\"\\n\\n\\nSo is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   \\n\\nI do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not\\nbillions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people\\nfall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.\\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\\n\\nMy hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the\\ntruck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out\\nof the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if\\nhe so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that\\nto change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,\\nBrian hasn\\'t gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he\\ndoes not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his\\nhead will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is\\nsatisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. \\n\\nThank you again Rob for your reproach.  I really do appreciate it.  (My\\nwife tells me the same thing at times.)   :-)   I will try to do better.\\n',\n",

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig\\'s fame is often\\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\\n(\\'21) and Philosophical Investigation (\\'53).  Many of Witt\\'s comments and\\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt\\'s\\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt\\'s own\\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\\na threshold.\\n  vonWrights\\'s comment that Witt\\'s \"sentences have a content that often lies\\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

It is an S3\\n86c805 based card.  I had a problem for a while after installing my\\nsecond meg of DRAM for the video, and thanks to Orchid, I got a fix\\nfrom their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the\\nordinary manual.  I assume it would come with memory ordered from\\nthem, so I guess I should be glad they didn\\'t just say \"Buy the memory\\nfrom us\" or something like that.)\\n\\n\\tThe one thing that I was puzzled by was why there was not a\\n1024x768x32k color mode on the thing, either in full screen or\\nenlarged desktop mode.  My ATI Ultra Plus can handle that, given 2MB\\nof memory.  All the 2MB buys you on the Fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.\\nJust ONE more mode.  GEEZ.  Had I known, I wouldn\\'t have bothered.  I\\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\\nOrchid\\'s software developers are busy with other projects.\"\\n\\n\\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I\\'d love to\\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\\nsystem and it\\'s not so easy to exchange these things unless they\\'re\\nbroken.\\n\\n\\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I\\'ve only seen one s3 86c805\\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\\n\\n\\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.\\n\\nThanks.\\ndonyee@athena.mit.edu\\n',\n",

This genocide was to insure that Turks exclusively\\nruled over the geographic area today called the Republic of Turkey. The \\nresult: 1.5 million murdered, 30 billion dollars of Armenian property stolen\\nand plundered. This genocide ended nearly 3,000 years of Armenian civilization\\non those lands. Today, the Turkish government continues to scrape clean any\\nvestige of a prior Armenian existence on those lands. Today\\'s Turkish\\ngovernmental policy is to re-write the history of the era, to manufacture\\ndistortion and generate excuses for their genocide of the Armenian people. In \\nthe face of refutation ad nauseam, the Turkish Historical Society and cronies \\nshamelessly continue to deny that any such genocide occurred. This policy \\nmerely demonstrates that in the modern era, genocide is an effective state \\npolicy when it remains un-redressed and un-punished. A crime unpunished is a \\ncrime encouraged.

An awful lot of the\\nstarvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic\\npolicies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical\\nWesterner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible\\nmalnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can\\nbe fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They\\nhave to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans\\nwe encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre\\nidea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they\\'ve got.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s more accurate to say that there\\'s a Western ethic against\\nWestern infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children\\nare dying in the Third World, we couldn\\'t give a shit.  And that goes for the\\nsupposed \"Pro-Life\" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by\\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\\nabortion.  Hell, if they\\'re only interested in fetuses, they could save more\\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\\n\\nAnd besides, Suzanne\\'s answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don\\'t believe this to be the case.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n',\n",

I am as concerned about the media\\'s complicity in this\\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\\nbehind it.  What\\'s going on here?\\n\\nLet\\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\\nI\\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\\nbecause I\\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\\'s behavior was\\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\\'s religious\\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.

       "  'From: tomh@metrics.com (Tom Haapanen)\\nSubject: RFD: comp.os.ms-windows.nt.{misc,setup}\\nOrganization: Software Metrics Inc.\\nLines: 76\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: rodan.uu.net\\n\\nThis is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two\\nnew newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\\n\\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\\n\\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \\n\\nVOTING:\\n\\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\\n\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.  No votes will\\n\\tbe accepted prior to the CFV.\\n-- \\n[ /tom haapanen -- tomh@metrics.com -- software metrics inc -- waterloo, ont ]\\n[       \"stick your index fingers into both corners of your mouth.  now pull ]\\n[          up.  that\\'s how the corrado makes you feel.\"  -- car, january \\'93 ]\\n',\n",

The parts are\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\nWe don\\'t have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don\\'t ask.\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]\\'\\' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\n\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\\n* What are the US export regulations?\\n* What is TEMPEST?\\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n* Is RSA patented?\\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\\n\\n\\n* What is the National Security Agency (NSA)?\\n\\n  The NSA is the official security body of the U.S. government. It\\n  was given its charter by President Truman in the late 40\\'s, and\\n  has continued research in cryptology till the present. The NSA is\\n  known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world,\\n  and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the\\n  world. Governments in general have always been prime employers of\\n  cryptologists. The NSA probably possesses cryptographic expertise many\\n  years ahead of the public state of the art, and can undoubtedly break\\n  many of the systems used in practice; but for reasons of national\\n  security almost all information about the NSA is classified.\\n\\n  Bamford\\'s book [BAMFD] gives a history of the people and operations of\\n  the NSA. The following quote from Massey [MAS88] highlights the\\n  difference between public and private research in cryptography:\\n\\n  ``... if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government,\\n  one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted\\n  behind closed doors. Without doubt, the number of workers engaged\\n  today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of\\n  those engaged in open research in cryptology. For only about 10\\n  years has there in fact been widespread open research in\\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflicts\\n  between these two research communities. Open research is common\\n  quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open\\n  exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in\\n  scholarly journals. But can a government agency, charged with\\n  responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations,\\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\\n  a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might\\n  undermine the effectiveness of his own government\\'s code-breakers?\\n  One might argue that publication of a provably-secure cipher would\\n  force all governments to behave like Stimson\\'s `gentlemen\\', but one\\n  must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with\\n  political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most\\n  scientific fields. The wonder is not that some conflicts have\\n  occurred between government agencies and open researchers in\\n  cryptology, but rather that these conflicts (at least those of which\\n  we are aware) have been so few and so mild.\\'\\'\\n\\n* What are the US export regulations?\\n\\n  In a nutshell, there are two government agencies which control\\n  export of encryption software. One is the Bureau of Export\\n  Administration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\\n  the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Another is the Office\\n  of Defense Trade Controls (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\\n  by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As a rule\\n  of thumb, BXA (which works with COCOM) has less stringent\\n  requirements, but DTC (which takes orders from NSA) wants to see\\n  everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to BXA.\\n\\n  The newsgroup misc.legal.computing carries many interesting\\n  discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export, what\\n  people think about those laws, and many other complex issues which\\n  go beyond the scope of technical groups like sci.crypt. Make sure to\\n  consult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who has at\\n  least heard of the ITAR.\\n\\n* What is TEMPEST?\\n\\n  TEMPEST is a standard for electromagnetic shielding for computer\\n  equipment. It was created in response to the discovery that\\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\\n  quite a distance and with little effort.\\n\\n  Needless to say, encryption doesn\\'t do much good if the cleartext\\n  is available this way.\\n\\n* What are the Beale Ciphers, and are they a hoax?\\n\\n  (Thanks to Jim Gillogly for this information and John King for\\n  corrections.)\\n\\n  The story in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goes: Thomas\\n  Jefferson Beale and a party of adventurers accumulated a huge mass\\n  of treasure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\\n  three ciphers with an innkeeper; the ciphers describe the\\n  location, contents, and intended beneficiaries of the treasure.\\n  Ward gives a decryption of the second cipher (contents) called B2;\\n  it was encrypted as a book cipher using the initial letters of the\\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) as key. B1 and B3 are unsolved;\\n  many documents have been tried as the key to B1.\\n\\n  Aficionados can join a group that attempts to solve B1 by various\\n  means with an eye toward splitting the treasure:\\n\\n  The Beale Cypher Association\\n  P.O. Box 975\\n  Beaver Falls, PA 15010\\n\\n  You can get the ciphers from the rec.puzzles FAQL by including the\\n  line:\\n\\n  send index\\n\\n  in a message to netlib@peregrine.com and following the directions.\\n  (There are apparently several different versions of the cipher\\n  floating around. The correct version is based on the 1885 pamphlet,\\n  says John King <kingj@hpcc01.corp.hp.com>.)\\n\\n  Some believe the story is a hoax. Kruh [KRU88] gives a long list of\\n  problems with the story. Gillogly [GIL80] decrypted B1 with the DOI\\n  and found some unexpected strings, including ABFDEFGHIIJKLMMNOHPP.\\n  Hammer (president of the Beale Cypher Association) agrees that this\\n  string couldn\\'t appear by chance, but feels there must be an\\n  explanation; Gwyn (sci.crypt expert) is unimpressed with this\\n  string.\\n\\n* What is the American Cryptogram Association, and how do I get in touch?\\n\\n  The ACA is an organization devoted to cryptography, with an emphasis\\n  on cryptanalysis of systems that can be attacked either with\\n  pencil-and-paper or computers. Its organ ``The Cryptogram\\'\\' includes\\n  articles and challenge ciphers. Among the more than 50 cipher types in\\n  English and other languages are simple substitution, Playfair,\\n  Vigenere, bifid, Bazeries, grille, homophonic, and cryptarithm.\\n\\n  Dues are $15 for one year (6 issues); more outside of North America;\\n  less for students under 18 and seniors. Subscriptions should be sent\\n  to ACA Treasurer, 18789 West Hickory St., Mundelein, IL 60060.\\n\\n* Is RSA patented?\\n\\n  Yes. The patent number is 4,405,829, filed 12/14/77, granted 9/20/83.\\n  For further discussion of this patent, whether it should have been\\n  granted, algorithm patents in general, and related legal and moral\\n  issues, see comp.patents and misc.legal.computing. For information\\n  about the League for Programming Freedom see [FTPPF]. Note that one of\\n  the original purposes of comp.patents was to collect questions such as\\n  ``should RSA be patented?\\'\\', which often flooded sci.crypt and other\\n  technical newsgroups, into a more appropriate forum.\\n\\n* What about the Voynich manuscript?\\n\\n  nelson@reed.edu (Nelson Minar) says there is a mailing list on the\\n  subject.  the address to write to subscribe to the VMS mailing list\\n  is: <voynich-request@rand.org>\\n\\n  the ftp archive is: rand.org:/pub/voynich\\n\\n  There\\'s all sorts of information about the manuscript itself, of\\n  course. A good bibliography can be found on the ftp site. Kahn\\'s\\n  \"The Codebreakers\" gives a good introduction.\\n',\n",

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew\\'s main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesus\\' (which means G\\'d is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G\\'d is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G\\'d walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus\\'s birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba\\'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea\\'s oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G\\'d.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus\\'s life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\'s gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\'s similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew\\'s purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson\\'s mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\'s chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations\\' salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew\\'s parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\'s attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew\\'s little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod\\'s mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people\\'s heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G\\'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G\\'d who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet\\'s warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon\\'s (and David\\'s) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\'s verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesus\\'s stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah\\'s verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\'s prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus\\'s parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew\\'s gospel even inserted Isaiah\\'s name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\'s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew\\'s prophecies aren\\'t the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn\\'t have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman\\'s arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealous enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\'s just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G\\'d\\'s appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G\\'d on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\'s presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G\\'d.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G\\'d.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G\\'d into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G\\'d as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G\\'d the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew\\'s version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew\\'s track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G\\'d,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\'s pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It\\'s tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus\\'s time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David\\'s\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus\\'s time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah\\'s advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH\\'s utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G\\'d.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\'s covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David\\'s age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David\\'s doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G\\'d had put his show of\\nfavour for David\\'s kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus\\'s question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\'s gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus\\'s career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G\\'d.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John\\'s little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\'s\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\'s field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'s\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew\\'s quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah\\'s context, whereas \"potter\\'s\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\'s track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas\\'s situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\'s work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus\\'s drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus\\'s clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus\\'s clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn\\'t do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus\\'s execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I\\'m sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm\\'s true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren\\'t bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus\\'s life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus\\'s\\ncrucifixion.  John\\'s gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus\\'s execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\'s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew\\'s attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\'s errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark\\'s recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\'s recount also disagrees with Mark\\'s.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G\\'d do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple\\'s\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles\\' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.\\n\\n       [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: \"Don\\'t think that I have come to\\n       bring peace on earth.  I haven\\'t come to bring peace,\\n       but rather a sword.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

A genocide of Armenians took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\\n\\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \\nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \\ndidn\\'t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\\nwouldn\\'t go into people\\'s apartments. About five o\\'clock we saw a large crowd \\nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \\nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \\nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \\nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn\\'t know \\nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nSuddenly there\\'s pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \\nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\\n\\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What\\'s going on? What\\'s \\nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don\\'t open the door, we \\nsay, \"If we have to leave, we\\'ll leave, we\\'ll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \\nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they\\'ve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \\nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \\npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \\nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \\nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \\nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \\ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \\nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \\nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \\nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \\nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \\nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \\nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \\nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \\none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \\nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What\\'s with you, \\nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \\nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \\nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \\n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \\nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \\ndon\\'t need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \\ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don\\'t \\nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \\nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \\ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \\nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \\nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\\'ll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \\none o\\'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \\ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we\\'re coming back \\nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \\nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \\nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \\nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \\nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor\\'s.\\n\\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\\n19 and 20, that\\'s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \\ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \\nweren\\'t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \\nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They\\'re up there, still,\\nup there. Let\\'s go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \\none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \\nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \\nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \\nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that\\'s from some of the \\nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o\\'clock. They smashed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\\n\\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \\ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don\\'t you now they\\'re checking all the \\napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \\nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\\'. At\\nfirst the man didn\\'t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o\\'clock at night. We heard the sound\\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \\ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \\nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \\nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \\nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \\nsaved. Our salvation--my mother\\'s, my brother\\'s, and mine,--was purely \\naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \\ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to save Mother. We couldn\\'t save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \\nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \\nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \\ntroops. And if troops hadn\\'t come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \\nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \\norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to \\'\\npick up Father\\'s corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o\\'clock \\nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \\nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \\nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \\nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman\\'s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \\nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\\'s body. It \\nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \\nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \\nman there, too, several men. You couldn\\'t tell anything because their faces \\nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\\n\\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people\\'s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\\n\\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\\'t even afraid of the troops. They\\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \\nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \\nweren\\'t afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \\ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \\nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \\nweren\\'t afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \\nat the neighbors\\' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \\noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \\nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone\\'s aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\\n\\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \\nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \\nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \\nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\\n\\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\\'s leadership, and to the\\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \\nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\\n\\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\\npossible punishment, because if they don\\'t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \\nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\\nout for such deeds.\\n\\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \\ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \\nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\\'s how many people took \\npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\\n\\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \\nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\\n\\n   May 18, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

You see, unless you believe in some mystical link\\nbetween Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man\\nwas credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky.

My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started  \\nshowing the same behavior.\\n\\nI replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost  \\nabout $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to  \\nrebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would  \\nhave cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.\\n\\nThe Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the  \\nengine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky  \\npart was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench  \\nrounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.   \\nWow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt  \\nthe new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.\\n\\nThis is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair  \\nmanual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake  \\ncylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.\\n\",\n",

There is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in\\nPC's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input\\nvia a DOS call rather than a BIOS call (as menus often use) otherwise the code\\nto update the date after midnight never gets called. \\n\\nSomebody might be able to correct the details in case I've mis-rememberred\\nthem, but I think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)\\nor add a TSR or system patch or something.

The Preamble declares that the\\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by \\'the people of the\\n  the U.S.\\'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\\n  to keep and bear Arms ....\"\\n\\t- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).\\n\\nFurthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution\\nfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not\\npresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the\\ngovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held that\\nthe amendment protected the individual right to possess military\\nweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\\ninterpretation.\\n\\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\\n\\n \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\"\\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\\n\\nYou might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about\\nmilitias mean?\"\\n\\nWell, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the\\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\\n\"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17).\\n\\n   \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\\n    the kind in common use at the time.\"\\n\\t- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\\n\\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\\nthe other way around.\\n\\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason\\n   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last\\n   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\"\\n     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776\\n       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C.

Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be\\n   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"\\n     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in\\n       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).\\n\\n   \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;\\n   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme\\n   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;\\n   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute\\n   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on\\n   any pretense, raised in the United States.\"\\n     - Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles\\n       of the Federal Constitution\" (1787), in Pamphlets on the\\n       Constitution of the United States (P.

Those scholars did indeed have an excellent\\nreason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked several Lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nA couple simply stated \"hanged oneself\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand stated that \"apacgw\" means specifically \"kill yourself by hanging.\" A\\ncouple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for \"apacgw\" is\\n\"strangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who\\nsuggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best\\nreferences though, \"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the\\nliteral translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also\\nother presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" has two root words: \"gchw\" is the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" means literally \"away.\" This root words is included in\\nwords which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" means to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifically makes comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which means \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" means \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" does mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he\\nstate that it means \"to hang oneself, to end one\\'s life by hanging.\" He then\\nnotes the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresents that example of \"apacgw\" as being used to explicitly mean \"suicide by\\nhanging.\" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and as you insist that the Bible was written by\\nGod, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" was used, then death is\\ndenoted as the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),\\n> it\\'s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice \\n> was not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house,\\n> to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and \\n> died; and he was buried in his father\\'s tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> ^^^^ \\n> Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel \"hanged himself\" [Gr. Sept.,\\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\n> result.\\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and died\"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" as the man did indeed die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions\\nwhich contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily\\nexecuted by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it\\nnow stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless\\nassertions without corresponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above\\nwhat the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, as to Mr Rose\\'s statement about trees around the Potter\\'s Field:\\n\\n> There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n\\nUnless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two\\nthousand years ago (after all, things change). \\n\\nNow as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same\\nas the 30 silvers:\\n\\n> As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the\\n> money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather\\n> than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically\\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions\\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 \"...concerning\\n> Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.\").  Now I would point out\\n> that when the Bible describes an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\n> discusses \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to suggest that\\n> it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.\"\\n> \\n>  \\n> Notice that in verse 16, the word \"iniquity\" is not used.  Rather, it states\\n> that Judas \"became a guide to those who arrested Jesus\".\\n> But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, \"for he was numbered with us and\\n> obtained a part in this ministry.\"  What part did Judas play in their ministry?\\n>          ^^^^^^\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas\\' betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas\\'\\nactions \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took\\nthe money box, but rather said:\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the feast\"; or that he should give something\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and\\n     it was night.\"\\n\\nNote that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" means suicide.  You see, since Judas\\' hanging was\\nsuccessful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:\\nPassover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself\\nthe next day.  Thus the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver\\nthat night as well, and thus couldn\\'t have spent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the house of cards is comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.\\n\\nBy the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter\\'s field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you say:\\n\\n> Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss\\n> this with you.\\n\\nI am reminding you now to discuss it now. It\\'s all part of the same verse we\\nare discussing, and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping \\nthese issues.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philosopher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding\\n\\n    PS. I would note again, that you are not stating that that Bible\\n    is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.\\n    Since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely \"possible\"\\n    reconciliations (I of course don\\'t rate them that highly), then the \\n    best you can do is say that the Bible is \"possibly\" inerrant, not that \\n    it *is* inerrant.\\n',\n",

Ages & sexes of children\\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\\n\\n>2.  Do you spank your kids?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\\n\\n>3.  If so how often?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking because it\\'s more of a reaction to something\\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\\nnot been spanked yet.\\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.\\n\\n>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?\\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\\'s too traumatic they never recall\\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\\nto go get a toolmeans you\\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\\nimpact.  It\\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\\nis called a spanking.\\n>\\n>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?\\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\\nsure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him\\nlose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.\\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep\\narguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine.\\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they\\ncalm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they\\'re\\nreally young.\\n\\n>6.  Your age?\\n     40\\n\\n>7.  Your location\\n     Bath, Ohio.  It\\'s right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\\n\\n>8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal\\n>offence?\\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn\\'t always required - parents use\\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\\n\\n>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid\\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\\'s have never\\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.\\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\\'ll admit I\\'ve been tempted with\\nat times.  When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\\ndevil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\\'s\\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.\\n-- \\nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \\'cause Heaven is just a great\\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\\n',\n",

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``.

(In your\\nclarinet posting you edited out some stuff; was it the following???)\\nFriday\\'s New York Times reported that this group definitely is\\nmore conservative than even Sheikh Baz and his followers (who\\nthink that the House of Saud does not rule the country conservatively\\nenough).  The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\\n\\n\\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\\n\\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\\n\\t  brings the death penalty.  \\n\\n\\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn\\'t he Ilyess?\\n\\n\\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\\n\\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\\n\\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\\n\\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\\n\\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\\n\\t  prostitutes.\\n\\n\\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I\\'ve\\n\\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\\n\\t  has no basis in the Qur\\'an, the ahadith, etc.\\n\\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\\n\\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \\n\\n\\t  If I were you, I\\'d choose my heroes wisely,\\n\\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\\n\\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\\n\\n\\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\\n\\n\\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\\n\\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\\nlast six months or so I\\'ve read there have been stepped up harassing\\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).

The risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.  \\nIndeed, candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic \\nmycosis.\"  Neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic \\ninfection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or \\n\"sick\" neutrophils to see a systemic infection.  Poor diet and persistent \\nparasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.\\nYour assessment of candidiasis in the U.S. is correct and I do not dispute \\nit.\\n\\nWhat I posted was a discussion of candida blooms, without systemic \\ninfection.  These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \\ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \\nblooms.  Let me quote from Zinsser\\'s again: \"However, some factors, such as \\nthe use of a broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotic, may predispose to \\nboth mucosal and systemic infections\".  I was addressing mucosal infections\\n(I like the term blooms better).  The nutrition course that I teach covers \\nthis effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the \"cure\".  I guess that \\nyour nutrition course does not, too bad.  \\n\\n\\n>>Here is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\n>>called, are not truely caused by yeasts.

For any information, contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si). \\n\\nDear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993\\n\\nNumber 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you \\nwill receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured\\nin the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page\\n-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited\\npart of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for\\nknowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);\\nand news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor\\'s profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should\\nbe instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the \\nunderstanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.\\n   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have\\na stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular\\nnumber can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation\\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,\\nyou will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning\\nour common interest and job.\\n\\nAt the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in\\nevery mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various\\npossibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and \\nphilosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,\\nand on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give\\nproposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail\\nand by other means.\\n\\nSincerely yours,\\n\\nAnton P. \"Zeleznikar\\nEditor-in-chief\\n',\n",

Islam \\n>is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. But it is not\\n>, yes definitely not, an ethinic group. ok! so, these Bosnian Muslims, who\\n>are they? to which ethnic group do they belong? what language(s) do they\\n>speak? do they have a different language from that of the Serbs or Croats? \\n\\nIn Bosnia, \"Muslim\" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic\\none as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\\nmade by people on this subject:\\n\\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\\n\\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\\n\\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\\nclue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although\\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\\n\\n>the way the western press use the word \\'muslim\\' in this Bosnian debacle has \\n>kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim/moslem i knew from childhood was \\n>changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended!\\n\\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \\nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\\n\\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\\n\\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\\n\\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \\nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\\n\\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\\ndominate people\\'s thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n-Josip\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The clutch had no effect.\\n   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is\\n      fully depressed.\\n   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.\\n   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was\\n      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if\\n      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)\\n   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having \\n      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),\\n      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.\\n   6- The shifter acted normally after that.\\n\\nWhen this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the \\nclutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.\\n\\nI had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last\\nweek.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because \\nMitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the\\nproblem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while\\nthey had the car.  \\nIn all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,\\nand since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed\\nto the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily\\nsolving the problem).

The\\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\\n\\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\\nmini-sequence.\\n\\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\\n\\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65150  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated\\nin the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.  Major command activities included commands to perform the initial\\nRRA slew test, uplink the RRA slew test mini-sequence, DACs to reposition the\\nstator and turn the TWNC on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the\\nRRA slew test.\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n',\n",

Just a simple question.\\n\\n...with a simple answer!\\n\\n[EE] As far as I know most of the Armenians belong to the Gregorian Orthodox\\n[EE] faith and such was the case in nineteenth century Ottoman Empire. It is\\n[EE] also known that some Armenian communities were converted into Catholicism\\n[EE] and Protestantism by the Western European missionaries in this period. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Armenians in eastern Anatolia were Gregorian or Armenian\\nApostolic. There was, however, a higher percentage of non-Gregorian Armenians \\nin Cilicia, closer to the Mediterranean, in Adana, Marash, Aintab, etc.  \\n\\n[EE] Another known fact is that almost half of the Armenians living in Anatolia\\n[EE] did not speak any Armenian, but used Turkish in their everyday lives.\\n\\nThis is not true. While it was forbidden for Armenians to speak Armenian in\\ncertain areas of Cilician Armenia, most all Armenians spoke Armenian. In fact,\\nTurks who interacted with Armenians also spoke Armenian! For sure, most all\\nArmenians, especially men, also knew Turkish in order to function in larger \\nsociety.\\n\\n[EE] My question is, given so many separations in the Armenian community, what\\n[EE] was the common denominator of the Armenian people that allowed Armenian\\n[EE] nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century? As I stated, religion\\n[EE] was not uniform (unlike the Greeks) and many Armenians couldn\\'t even speak\\n[EE] Armenian. I would like to know what factors brought the Armenians in the\\n[EE] Ottoman Empire together and led to the formation of an Armenian \\n[EE] consciousness.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Turkey were persecuted because they were Armenian, regardless\\nof the specific branch of Christianity they professed. The resultant Armenian\\nnationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. Even at the later \\nstages of WWI, and after the genocide, many Armenians who were converted to \\nIslam were also exterminated because they continued as Armenian Moslems. This \\npractice continued well into the 1920s by Ataturk in parallel with the policy \\nof clearing out pockets of steadfast Islamic fundamentalism. Many of these\\nconverted Armenians, ironically, in order to stay alive, were staunch Moslems. \\n\\n[EE] Any information will be appreciated.\\n\\nYou answered your own question!

If players\\' performance was completely random\\nin (Clutch-No Clutch), then you would still expect some players to be\\ngood in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.\\nWith two years worth of data, you\\'d have 1/4 of the players good each\\nyear, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.\\nWe have 96 players for 5 years (\\'84-\\'88).  Just flipping a coin, you\\'d\\nexpect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.\\nThis is what we actually get--\\n\\nNo. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5\\nClutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3\\nCoin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3\\n\\nEssentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years\\nof good performance is the same as what you would get if the process\\nleading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.\\nIf there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)\\nthat had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of\\nplayers at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping\\na coin.  Further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above\\nor below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from \\nthe mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.\\nIn the four years (\\'84-\\'87) that I looked at the data from Elias, there\\nwere 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch \\nsituations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  Of\\nthose 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two\\nyears.  In other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and\\nreally horrible the other year.  If it was just a random process, \\nyou\\'d expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  \\n\\nEverything that\\'s been measured about clutch hitting over a period\\nof years that could be used to predict any ability with any \\nproposed definition has looked like a random process (with the \\ncaveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage\\nthat could be dragged out of the data--e.g., John Lowenstein \\nprobably never had a \"clutch\" AB against a left-handed pitcher,\\nbut he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would\\nbe a bias since his clutch ABs would be more geared to his \\nplatoon advantage).  This is not a subject that has been glanced\\nat casually.  A lot of people have put a lot of effort into \\nstudying it and every one of them, with the exception of the\\nElias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow\\nyou to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better\\nthan flipping a coin.

Within hours, the    \\ncompound became an inferno. Nine Branch Davidians excaped.\\n   This is their story, gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them\\nwho are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. That day the \\nsix said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world    \\nsince Koresh's right-hand man, Steve Schneider, ripped out the compounds's \\nphone line after FBI agents called before dawn Monday saying this was the\\ncults last chance: Come out or prepare to get forced out.\\n    They kept their word. By dawn, tanks were battering the Mount Carmel\\ncompound, punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. The BD\\nmeanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. Strapped into gas masks, the\\nwomen did laundry. Others read Bibles in their rooms. The 17 children, all\\nunder 10, remained by their mothers' sides. Still, it was hard to ignore what    \\nwas happening around them. Each time a tank rammed the poorly-constructed building\\nit shook violently. Cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.\\nHundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling\\nthe air with noxious fumes. The flying canisters were more frightening than\\nthe tanks. At least one man was hit in the face. The gas began filling the air,\\ndriven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks\\nmade. Scattered throughout the house, the cult members made no efforts to\\ngather. Then the FBI sent in its biggest weapon -- a massive armored vehicle\\nheaded for a chamber, lined with cinder blocks, where authorities hoped to \\nfind Koresh and Schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.\\n  Here the cult members' story diverges from the government's version. The\\nFBI says cult members set fires in three places. But each of the six cult\\nmembers, in separate discussions with lawyers, consistently gave versions\\nat odds with the FBI's account. They say the tank flattened a barrel of \\npropane, spilling its contents. And as the tank thundered through the house,\\nit tipped over lit lanterns, spitting flames that ignited the propane and\\nother flammables. The home of used lumber, plywood, and wallboard tacked \\ntogether with tar paper was vulnerable. The building erupted. Nine BD's\\nescaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings.

They are not important when the final\\nresult is decided.  If I get the time soon, I'll watch the game again and\\nemail you a list of lucky Montreal bounces and a list of Quebec offensive\\nscrewups.  Montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  The goalie\\nis the last line of defence, and I will grant that extra attention is\\nfocussed on him, sometimes without justification.  But Roy gave up a *lousy*\\ngoal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.\\n\\n>>Roy looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.\\n\\n>And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. \\n\\nWHO CARES?  Of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally\\nunrelated lousy play?  I could do a Hextall critique if you'd like.  But if\\nyou're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key\\nsaves at the key times.\\n\\n>Roy is paid big money because\\n>that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5\\n\\nFor the record, I did not say that Roy was not one of the top goaltenders in\\nthe league.

That this would be absent from our school texts,\\n   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion\\n   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express\\n   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were\\n   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the\\n   American psyche.\\n   ...\\n      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the\\n   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited\\n   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors\\n   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged\\n   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at\\n   Albany Congress: \"It would be a strange thing...if six nations\\n   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union\\n   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted\\n   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should\\n   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.\"\\n      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs\\n   and congressional delegates in order to \"hammer out a plan that he\\n   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.\"\\n\\nGrinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California\\nat Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the\\nAmerican Nation_ addresses this issue.\\n--\\nDoug Graham         dgraham@bnr.ca         My opinions are my own.\\n',\n",

Do let me know\\n>: which... :-)\\n>\\n>A brilliant example of using the introspective objection against \\n>materialist theories of consciousness.\\n\\nDiplomatic :-)\\n\\nI realize I\\'m fighting Occam\\'s razor in this argument, so I\\'ll try to\\nexplain why I feel a mind is necessary. \\n\\nFirstly, I\\'m not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n>\\n>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be\\n>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue\\n>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions\\n>occur?\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>Petri\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

The facts supported\\nBoomer\\'s contention that Atlantic Cement was wrongfully damaging his\\nproperty, and Boomer asked the court to order Atlantic Cement to stop\\ndoing so.  End of story.  There was no reason for the court to consider\\nsuch issues as what a capitalistic society would want Atlantic Cement to\\ndo or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage\\nfaced by the plaintiffs.

Faced with situations in which the wrong has\\nalready been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place\\nand cannot be reversed or undone, courts will try to set an equitable\\nprice tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer\\nto pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might\\nprefer).  In these cases, the \"sale\" has already taken place and is\\nirreversible, and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is\\npaid, under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should\\neven a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and\\n(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or\\ninequitable manner from his victimhood.  Both of these doctrines may be\\nworth discussing or debating elsewhere, but neither is relevant to cases\\nlike _Boomer_ in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it\\nare still in the future and _can_ be reversed/undone (i.e., prevented\\nfrom happening at all) by order of the court.\\n\\nIn these types of cases, all the court has to do is require that the\\npotential victim\\'s property rights are protected until and unless he\\nagrees to sell them at a mutually-acceptable price.  There is no need\\nfor the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both\\nsides to accept its finding.  It can leave that operation up to the\\nparties themselves.\\n\\n>> And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\\n>> business of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\\n>> (If so, I\\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\\n>> supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\\n>\\n> Unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.\\n\\nIn cases like _Boomer_, they\\'re simply a cost of doing business.  The\\nfact that the proprietors of the Atlantic Cement Co. got themselves into\\na position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a\\nresult of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant\\nwithout _first_ trying to negotiate with Boomer and everyone else whose\\nproperty rights they\\'d be violating via the operation of their plant.\\nThere\\'s nothing punitive or unjust about it.\\n\\n>> (2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\\n>> right of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\\n>> losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\\n>> the alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\\n>> not have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\\n>> own property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\\'s wrongful acts.\\n>> [wdstarr]\\n>\\n> Anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire\\n> set of possessions to wronged person?

(What Microsoft means by \"Device Independent\" is unclear to\\n    me.) Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit\\n    pixels.\\n\\n    These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.\\n    If\\tyou  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-\\n    swap all short and long integer values.\\n\\n    By convention, DIB images end in the extension \".BMP\".

Consequently you\\n    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as \"BMP\" files.\\n\\n    Since DIB images files are a super-set, there are three \"flavors\"  of  DIB\\n    images:\\n\\t o   DOS DIB images.  These are the recommended\\t convention,  and  the\\n\\t     form  which I will describe how to create.\\t They are intended for\\n\\t     applications running under MS Windows /3.0 in a DOS environment.\\n\\t o   OS/2 DIB images.  My understanding is that these are  the\\tflavor\\n\\t     of DIB images that were used by the Presentation Manager.\\n\\t o   Old-style Bitmap images.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t      March 15, 1991\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t    - 3 -\\n\\n\\n    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS\\n\\n    The DOS DIB images consist of:\\n\\t 1.  A \"BITMAPFILEHEADER\" file header which identifies the file\\t as  a\\n\\t     DIB  file.\\t  This\\theader\\talso gives the total size of the image\\n\\t     file, and the offset to the image data.\\n\\t 2.

If  it  exists,\\n\\t     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  Each entry is a Windows\\n\\t     RGBQUAD structure.\\n\\t 4.

A \"BITMAPCOREHEADER\"  image  header  which\\t specifies  the\\t image\\n\\t     attributes.\\n\\t 3.  An optional palette of colors used by the image.

So,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel\\n    wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   The\\n    number of bytes per line can be calculated as:\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\t---or, in terms of the fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure---\\n\\n\\t\\t bytes_per_line = (biWidth * biBitCount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;\\n\\n\\n    When writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.\\n    The\\t bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the\\n    first line of image data in the file.\\n\\n    For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written\\tas  you\\t would\\n    expect.   One  bit\\timages\\tare  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  Four bit\\n    images are padded two pixels to a byte.  Eight bit images are written  one\\n    pixel per byte.  Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.\\n    However, for 24-bit images the information must  be\\t written  out  in  the\\n    order  blue,  green, red.

I mean, it was the\\nFinnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous\\npenalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a\\nmatch penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and\\nseconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for \"delay of game\"\\nfor a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd.

It is true that there is a\\ngreat danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience\\nmost of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as\\na big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now.

But if you can contrive\\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\\n\\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\\n\\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\\nthoughts.\\n\\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\\ncommon by more than one person.  A\\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\\n\\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \\ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\\n\\nSo... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\\nof another alternative?  respond by post or email.\\n\\nthanks very much\\n\\n*dt*\\n\\n========================================================\\n\\n.\\n\",\n",

For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren\\'t living in a\\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn\\'t\\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn\\'t have any explosives or\\nsimilar munitions?  I just don\\'t buy what the ATF and FBI have been\\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\\n\\nHere\\'s something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\\ndon\\'t think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn\\'t due to something like TNT,\\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\\n\\nIsn\\'t it curious that the ATF wasn\\'t very forthcoming about how the four\\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN\\'T READY TO RELEASE\\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\\n\\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\\nbody during one of the lawyer\\'s visits to the compound.  Later on\\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don\\'t know if it was a dud or a\\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn\\'t it be\\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won\\'t investigate until the\\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\\nyou know what I mean.

       "  \"Subject: Flames Final Stats and Playoff News\\nFrom: caldwell8102@mtroyal.ab.ca\\nOrganization: Mount Royal College, Calgary, Alberta\\nLines: 118\\n\\nNews:\\n=====\\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \\na major part of the team. \\n\\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 1:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing? Where's this guy from.....)\\n \\nUpcoming games:\\n==============\\nFriday April 23, at L.A.\\nSunday April 25, at L.A.\\nTuesday April 27, home to L.A. \\nThursday April 29, at L.A.

Some restrict the term\\'s meaning to \"active male\\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \\nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \\nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\\n\\n                      *************************************\\n\\n                                   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \\nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\\n\\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\\nministry. \\n\\n\\nFootnotes:\\n_______________________\\n 1.  For convenience sake, the term \"homosexual\" is used to encompass both\\nsame-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of\\nthe main considerations of this study.\\n 2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn\\n(Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it\\nis a \"term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent.\" \\nUnknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and\\nstudy.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral\\nEpistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie,\\nNew Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive\\ndiscussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).\\n 3. For example, see Scroggs\\' influence on M. Olson, \"Untangling the Web,\" The\\nOther Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition\\nof homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, \"Unconvering the Father\\'s Skirt,\"\\nVT 30/1 (Jan, 1980) 38-43.  For a bibliography of other sources dealing with\\narsenokoitai, see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes (NY: H.

I don\\'t think so, not from what I heard. He lived\\n>ONE DAY of suffering and died. If the wages of sin is the above paragraph, then\\n>JESUS DIDN\\'T PAY FOR OUR SINS, DID HE?\\n\\nThis is something I\\'ve always found a little curious. I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I love it,\\nbut I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or\\ntraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.\\nI have heard various people (outside this news group)\\ndescribe *idols* such as power, money, material \\npossessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I \\nsuppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  \\n\\nI have been reading the postings in this news group (which I \\njust found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I\\'m\\nnot trying to question anyone\\'s belief or try to push my views\\non anyone else (I haven\\'t been at this long enough to have\\nany views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,\\nI must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that\\nI could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that\\nevery time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in\\nChrist\\'s side because He took the punishment for my sins,\\nwhen He died on the cross).\\n\\nIn my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, \\nbut that\\'s about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary \\ncould be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?\\n\\nIt sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself\\nI\\'m sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend\\nthe summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about\\nTongues (I\\'m reading \"Charismatic Chaos\").  I guess I\\'ll study\\nTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can \\ngive me will be appreciated.\\n\\n    -------------------------------------------\\n\\n[I don\\'t think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\\ndifferent tradition than yours.\\n\\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\\nSince this isn\\'t in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\\nunderstand in this way if they didn\\'t already believe it), Protestants\\ndon\\'t accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\\n\\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it\\'s a matter\\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\\nwho don\\'t.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I\\'d \\nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\\n\\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they\\'re sort of halfway between\\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\\n  Church of Christ\\n\\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\\nquite marked.\\n\\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\\ngive a feeling for their nature.  Unfortunately I\\'m away from my\\nlibrary at the moment, so I don\\'t have anything specific to recommend.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

The problem with a \"moment of\\nsilence\" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of \"allowing\" for religion\\namongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need\\nmore than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are\\nrequired by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also\\nhas requirements that are not addressed by this.\\n\\nThere is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in\\nthis \"moment of silence\" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that\\nChristian prayer DOESN\\'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally\\nincognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews\\nas well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some\\ncharacteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special\\ntimes and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer \\nbeing able taking note of it.)\\n\\nA Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of\\nhis activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the\\nother religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME\\nforms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant\\n\"mainstream\" religion.\\n\\nAll that a \"moment of silence\" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which\\ndoesn\\'t NEED it, to have a \"special\" place set aside in the public schools.\\nThere is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,\\nor phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A\\nChristian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during\\nthe day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-\\nChristians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the \"moment of silence\" it\\nwould STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims\\nto do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed\\nforms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,\\nthe provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.\\n\\nLuckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as\\na Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),\\nand a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political\\nforces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms\\non non-Christians.\\n\\nAs far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this \"moment of\\nsilence\" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE\\nchildren to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And\\nas a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it\\'s worth, I\\nsuspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --\\nit is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in \"making\"\\ntheir children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach\\nwhat THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in\\nthe world to do so.\\n\\nIf you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of\\nsilence in school.

       "  'From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre)\\nSubject: Theists And Objectivity\\nOrganization: University of Nebraska at Omaha\\nLines: 82\\n\\nCan a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial\\n     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or\\n     will he assume the superstition of his parents\\n     when questioning? \\n\\nI\\'ve often found it to be the case that the theist\\n     will stick to some kind of superstition when\\n     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I\\'ve\\n     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,\\n     and the other theists alike.  All assume that\\n     their mothers and fathers were right in the\\n     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief\\n     search for their god.\\n     \\nOccasionally, the theist may switch religions or\\n     aspects of the same religion, but overall the\\n     majority keep to the belief that some \"Creator\"\\n     was behind the universe\\'s existence.  I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \\n     superstitions he\\'s been taught are nearly\\n     impossible to remove.\\n     \\nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\\n     of God\\'s existence and question it impartially?\\n     \\nStephen\\n\\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n',\n",

There will be such hitters in any league,\\njust as there will be hitters who hit poorly on Tuesdays.\\n\\nAnd there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between\\nclutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,\\nprobably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather\\nthan any ability.  *Based only on this data*, I don\\'t see any reason to\\npinch-hit for Sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch\\nhitter in the past.\\n\\nBut there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.\\nDoes the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (Any portion of\\nSabo\\'s clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a\\nreal ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)

Does this\\n>threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n  \\n   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried\\nout extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some\\ntime.  A good reference on this might be: \"Comparison of Propulsion\\nOptions for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-\\n0639).\" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper\\ndescribes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve\\naircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems\\nassociated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it\\'s a high-speed\\nairplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane\\n   The design (the concept is also called \"Beta\") as laid out in the\\npaper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000\\npounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and\\nlife support.  System design reliability is .9995.\\n   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets\\nand 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-\\nlong reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-\\nstage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy\\npayload on an expendable second stage.\\n   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a\\nnormal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,\\nmodified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,\\nwould take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing\\nout, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like\\naircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.\\n   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff\\nis about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.\\nThe orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs\\nof LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust\\nrocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,\\nwith the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-\\n25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would\\nbe stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design\\'s\\nsuccess is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact\\ntankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.\\n     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.

I\\'ve \\nbeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.\\nI didn\\'t know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \\nlike I haven\\'t read \"The Yeast Connection\").\\n\\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the \"Cold Fusion\" papers of \\nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \\nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I\\'m still not sure that if a \\nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \\nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\\n\\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \\ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \\ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\\nBut some things I just can\\'t buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \\noxidative damage in the body).\\n\\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \\nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \\nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \\nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \\ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \\nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \\ncouldn\\'t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I\\'m really \\nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \\nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \\nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \\nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \\n\\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \\nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \\nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \\nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \\nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\\n\\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I\\'ve seen speculation \\nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \\nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \\nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \\nseparate the fiction from the fact.\\n\\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \\nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What\\'s it doing \\nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \\nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \\nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\\n\\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \\ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \\nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \\nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \\nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \\nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \\npart of the ageing process in humans).\\n\\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \\ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \\nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \\nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \\ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \\nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \\ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \\nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \\nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \\ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \\nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \\ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\\n\\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \\nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \\na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \\nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don\\'t know any \\nbetter).\\n\\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \\nI\\'m inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \\nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \\nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I\\'m \\ngoing to give isn\\'t going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \\nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I\\'ll have to live with that label.\\n\\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert\\'s \\ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \\nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can\\'t remember the network or his \\nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \\nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \\nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \\ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \\ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \\ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \\nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \\n\\nI\\'m going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \\nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \\ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \\nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\\nHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your \\nsinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

The system may\\nnot rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units, but\\nit is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some\\nsuspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys\\nfrom escrow.  This necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal\\'s\\ncoercing or colluding use of some other person\\'s Clipper phone.\\n\\nI will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.\\nThe original title perhaps should have been \"Distinction between legal\\nand illegal cipher systems considered harmful\", but \"Clipper considered\\nharmful\" is not inaccurate, and is more eye-catching in the current context.\\n\\nAssumptions:\\n\\n  1.  Clipper is made available.\\n\\n  2.  Laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than Clipper illegal\\n      (either on radio systems, or on any common carrier system).  These laws\\n      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio\\n      spectrum (or other medium), characterize signals, validate Clipper\\n      wrappers, detect probable use of non-Clipper ciphers, and make such\\n      detection a cause for further action.\\n\\n  3.  For escrowed keys to be useful, some specific Clipper chip must be\\n      associated with a suspected criminal.  This means that at a minimum\\n      some association between the common carrier\\'s unique phone ID (ESN) and\\n      the Clipper chip serial number N will be stored in a government database.\\n      An observed pairing of N and ESN other than the one recorded raises a\\n      red flag.\\n\\n  4.  To reduce ordinary fraud, the cellphone system which offers Clipper\\n      will also be constructed with an ESN mechanism much more tamper-proof\\n      and much less spoofable than today\\'s cellphones.\\n\\n  5.  Criminals want inscrutable communications.  Some criminals are not\\n      entirely stupid or ignorant, and will figure out both that Clipper\\n      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances, and that\\n      they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably\\n      legitimate) wiretap order exists.  They will also figure out that the\\n      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone, because\\n      each one has a unique unit key.\\n\\n  6.  Criminals do not want to call attention to themselves.  Because they\\n      are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews), and because\\n      they know that their open use of a non-Clipper cipher is likely to be\\n      detected, they will generally avoid using non-Clipper ciphers directly\\n      on some monitorable/tappable channel.  They know that do so would raise\\n      a red flag, putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under\\n      immediate suspicion.\\n\\n  7.  It is impractical to reverse engineer Skipjack, discover family key F,\\n      and construct a functional clone of a Clipper chip.\\n\\nBy #2, #3, #4, and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given Clipper\\nphone without immediate detection.  Because it is difficult to obscure one\\'s\\nassociation to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips\\naround, the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is\\nassociated with someone else.\\n\\nA non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have Clipper-secure\\ncommunications, at least for some limited time T, if they buy, beg, borrow,\\nor steal use of someone\\'s phone in a way that prevents that person from\\nreporting compromise of the phone for at least time T.  The encrypted\\ncommunications might have been recorded, and thus be retrievable later,\\nbut the criminal can delay, and quite likely evade, discovery by destroying\\nor abandoning the phone before T elapses.\\n\\nIt would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their Clipper\\nphone to someone else.  The honest subscriber doesn\\'t want to pay someone\\nelse\\'s bill, and he doesn\\'t want to fall under suspicion.\\n\\nThis leaves two sources of Clipper phones for criminal use: coercion\\nand collusion.\\n\\nCoercion first.  Theft bears a relatively low risk, but also sometimes\\na low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from\\na car parked in front of a store, a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen\\nfrom someone who is away on vacation).  Criminal commerce is likely to\\narise in stolen Clipper phones, with phones coming from risk-inured poor\\ncriminals, and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals.  Someone\\nwho is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected\\ncommunication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.\\nThe limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means\\nthat continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of\\nfreshly coerced phones.\\n\\nThere would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively\\nwealthy criminals, and ignorant or don\\'t-care patsies who need money,\\nand who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to Clipper\\nphone service for someone else\\'s use.\\n\\nCriminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a\\nClipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-Clipper cipher to a normal\\ncellphone.  They will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to\\ntheir stolen phone) this way.  The fact of a phone\\'s use being coerced must\\nfirst be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone, and\\nhave its keys obtained from escrow.\\n\\nClipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to\\nconceal use of super-encryption.  An automated full-system surveillance\\nmechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key F,\\ncan validate Clipper wrappers and N:ESN associations, but it cannot reveal\\nin realtime the use of super-encryption, unless it knows all unit keys,\\nwhich we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate\\npieces, upon specific wiretap-like order.\\n\\nWhereas a criminal\\'s use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium\\nwould stand out, a criminal\\'s use of a non-Clipper cipher within a Clipper\\nmedium would be very difficult to detect, even ex post facto in bulk\\nrecordings, as long as the association between criminal and specific Clipper\\nchip is fractured.\\n\\nIf you make use of this other cipher illegal per se, then you can charge\\nthe criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal - he\\'ll be\\nusing someone else\\'s phone), but you\\'ll have no evidence to help you against\\nwhatever traditional crime he might have been planning.  You will not even be\\nable to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you\\nidentify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.\\n\\nThe gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more, not less, secure than\\nthey were before Clipper came along.\\n\\nI therefore consider Clipper harmful because:\\n\\n  1.  It does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against\\n      aggressive or dishonest government.\\n\\n  2.  If other ciphers are proscribed, it engenders new types of direct\\n      criminal threat to the honest public.\\n\\n  3.  It provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to\\n      hide their use of some other cipher, making it more difficult than\\n      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring\\n      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.\\n\\n  4.

El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).\\n> \\n\\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\\'an.\\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \\nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\\n\\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon \"God and\\nHis Messenger\" the situation changes. Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter\\n> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\nfamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?\" He (S.A.) replied:\\n\"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\\nare praised in both the Qur\\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \\nare cautioned.\\n\\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\\nheretic\\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\\n\\n> Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.

My question is whether that\\nstatement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.\\n\\nHate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I\\'ll leave it unnamed\\nsince I don\\'t want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not \\nsomething is a sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\\nwhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the \\nstronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so \\nstrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate\\nthe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and \\ndo things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even \\nbelieve what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins\\nto hate us (they certainly don\\'t love us for our constant criticism of their\\nbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly\\ncannot be a good way to build love.\\n\\nIn the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \\nneighbors. He doesn\\'t say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \\ncommands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians\\nsupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one\\nway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We\\nneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love \\nwith theirs.

It may be the Holy Spirit's\\nway of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that\\nwe can pray about it and have it removed.

Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples\\nof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  \\n\\nRegarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be\\ncareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially\\nif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.\\nChristians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate\\nan out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE\\nmight actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.\\nIn II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught\\nup into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really\\nleave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a\\nspirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters\\nthat much.  Paul could not tell.  \\n\\nBe that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan\\nto experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a \\nplace until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.

Scroggs\\n\\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\\n\\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\"\\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on\\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\\naffirms (109).\\n     This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \\nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\\n\\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\\nthe lists\" (104). \\n\\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\\nin today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\\nrelevant to today\\'s debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\\n\\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD. Wright\\n\\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s\\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \\nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s\\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\\n\\n     Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the\\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\\ngender\" (132). \\n\\n     It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \\nFor example, Aristides\\' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \\n\\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\\n\\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\\n\\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\\n\\n     Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be\\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing\\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \\n\\n     Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention\\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term.  Wright\\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \\n\\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited\\nconclusion based on them.\\n\\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\\n\\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \\n\\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul\\'s use of\\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\\n___________________________\\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \\nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\\n146BC to AD 1100).\\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul\\'s language in\\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul\\'s wors at the end of the\\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas\\' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\\n(147).\\n15  On Boswell\\'s treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell\\'s Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\\neffectively refutres Boswell\\'s claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \\nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \\n18  Wright\\'s endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\\n\\n \\n',\n",

That does not mean,\\n# however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  The\\n# entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for Jews\\n# to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of\\n# them, and which had been denied to them for millenia.\\n# \\n# On the other hand, throughout the rest of Jerusalem and Israel, to the\\n# best of my knowledge, Israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided\\n# damage to any Islamic religious sites. This contrasts with the policies\\n# of previous regimes which destroyed Jewish synagogues out of hate and\\n# bigotry.\\n\\n  Or, for that matter, with the USA.  Around here, nobody reroutes\\n  freeways to avoid churches, synagogues, and so forth.  They just\\n  get condemned, paid off, and the road goes through.  The same is\\n  standard policy for any number of other public projects: schools\\n  and sports arenas being only two examples.\\n\\n  Anticipating the objection that the cases aren\\'t comparable: how\\n  not?  The Wall has to count as the #1 tourist attraction in that\\n  part of the world; making room for the traffic would be a twenty\\n  second decision for any city council I ever heard of.\\n\\n--- D.

To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to\\nthe sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its\\napplication can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the\\ninternet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory\\n./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5\" diskette can be\\nordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address\\nbelow. \\n\\nThe base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp\\'ed from the\\nsame host.\\n\\nNote that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows\\nAUIS to compile under AIX3.2.\\n\\n-----------\\n\\nThe Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment\\non top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media\\napplications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the\\ncapability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that\\nnot only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but\\nalso  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,\\nequations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can\\nthemselves contain other objects, including text.\\n\\nAUIS has three components:\\n\\n    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set\\n    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help\\n    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell\\n    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various\\n    available types of objects. \\n\\n    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented\\n    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein\\n    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,\\n    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as\\n    easily as those that come with the system. \\n\\n    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface\\n    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail\\n    management strategies and implements many advanced  features\\n    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of\\n    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails\\n    of related messages, and subscription management. It also\\n    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and\\n    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function\\n    workstations. \\n\\nThe current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for\\nthe new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards\\nfor multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of\\nthe Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new\\neditors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.\\n\\n\\nRemote Andrew Demo Service\\n\\nYou can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew\\nDemo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11\\nwindow system.  You\\'ll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate\\nthrough the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System\\nto browse through a few of CMU\\'s four thousand bulletin boards and\\nnewsgroups.\\n\\nTo get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the\\nfollowing command on your machine:\\n\\n\\tfinger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu\\n\\nThe service will give you further instructions.   \\n\\n\\nMore information about Andrew is available from:\\n\\n    Information Requests\\n    Andrew Consortium\\n    Carnegie Mellon University\\n    Smith Hall 106\\n    5000 Forbes Avenue\\n    Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n    USA\\n    phone: +1-412-268-6710\\n    fax: +1-412-682-6938\\n    info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu\\n\\nContact info-andrew-request@andrew.cmu.edu for additional information.  \\n\\n',\n",

European policy is based on cultural and\\n   religious indifference, if not bigotry.  And I think it\\'s fair to say\\n   that this would be an entirely different situation if the Muslims\\n   were doing what the Serbs have done, if this was Muslim aggression\\n   instead of Serbian aggression.\\n\\nToo bad the Washington Post did not include his next sentence, which \\npointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger\\nwithin the Islamic world, the consequences of which we cannot begin\\nto predict.  Later, Biden told a reporter why he spoke out:\\n\\n   I think someone has to respond to Europe to make it clear\\n   this is a big deal... so they will understand.\\n\\nand it IS a big deal.  By refusing the fundamental human right of\\nself-defense to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Europe and the world have \\naided the Serbian aggression.  Moreover, the arms embargo has\\nforced a situation in which Bosnian Serbs have 10 times more heavy\\nweaponry than Bosnian Croats and Muslims combined.  Under such\\nconditions, it is very easy for Serbs to play a \"divide-and-conquer\"\\ngame, and to get the Muslims and Croats (who have strong common\\ninterests and who were allied against the Serbian aggression) \\nto start fighting each other, which leads to their mutual catastrophe.\\n\\nOne final quote:  U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has\\nsaid in Rome last week that \"In practice, the embargo had the opposite\\neffect intended.  It made aggression certain.\"\\n\\nAll diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace\\nwhile enforcing a 10:1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed\\nto this tragedy.\\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n-Josip\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

EDT\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal \\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law \\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled \\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.  \\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day \\nstandoff ensued.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every \\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without \\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were \\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were \\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably \\ninsane.      \\n\\n\\t     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both \\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover, \\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the \\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination \\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no \\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal \\nagents against the compound.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on \\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on \\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.  \\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even \\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause \\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people \\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I \\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I \\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what \\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the \\nimplementation of the decision.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.  \\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal \\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his \\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not \\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate \\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the \\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and \\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to \\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been \\ndone differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent \\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I \\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required \\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to \\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can \\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney \\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the \\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult \\ncircumstances.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry \\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end \\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be \\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David \\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over \\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult \\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will \\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future \\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what \\nhas been learned now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why, \\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is \\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation \\nwith --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go \\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I \\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about \\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General \\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another \\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she \\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted \\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause \\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it \\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was \\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I was further told that under no circumstances would our \\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to \\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and \\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful \\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.  \\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I \\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons \\nI was given were the following:\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the \\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the \\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be \\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had \\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced \\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to \\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult \\nmembers to come out.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Number three, that the danger of their doing something \\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with \\nthe passage of time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And number four, that they had reason to believe that \\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused \\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and \\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.  \\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had \\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and \\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said \\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were \\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only \\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third question I asked was, has the military been \\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco, \\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious \\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military \\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some \\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the \\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they \\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one \\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military \\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming \\nsignificance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I \\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she \\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that \\ntoday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were \\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only \\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only \\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to \\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather \\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who \\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into \\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events \\nto unfold.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people \\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General \\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.  \\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry \\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it \\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that \\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised \\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the \\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics \\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this \\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These \\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were \\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, \\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to \\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate \\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the \\nchildren.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno, \\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you \\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why \\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she \\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those \\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly \\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier \\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for \\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can we assume then that you don't think this was \\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of \\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really \\ndecide that way?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume \\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has \\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of \\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the \\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry \\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we \\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have \\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say \\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make \\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want \\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have \\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but \\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best \\nevidence we have.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of \\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it \\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do, \\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is \\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the \\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, were there any other options \\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from \\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all \\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go \\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good \\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued \\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them \\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of \\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to \\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the \\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things \\njust began to spin downward.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened \\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not \\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with \\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they \\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get \\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.  \\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the government know that the children did not \\nhave gas masks?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     congressional hearings once the situation -- are \\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do \\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the \\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring \\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any \\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully \\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the \\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the \\ncountry.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Go ahead, Sarah.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The \\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not \\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance \\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was \\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived \\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't \\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their \\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had \\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What federal laws --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't \\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the \\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they \\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but \\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of \\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of \\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were \\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that \\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have \\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground \\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be \\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if \\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane \\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace \\nwhere they could be protected.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned \\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas \\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks \\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they \\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a \\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked \\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you \\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your \\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had \\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the \\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that \\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues \\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would \\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in \\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were \\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the \\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate \\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were \\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.  \\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a \\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't \\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't \\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I \\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I \\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to \\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had \\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said, \\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you. \\nAnd I do support her.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     She is not ultimately responsible to the American \\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an \\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as \\nwell as she could have.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you.

I realize it is \\n> normally tossed out because it contains miracles, but what\\n> are the other reasons?\\n\\nFar from being \"tossed out,\" the gospels are taken, almost\\nuniversally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.\\nI am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer\\'s \"Historian\\'s Fallacies\"\\nas a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy\\nto read texts present history.  It\\'s relatively cheap.  It\\'s easy\\nto read.  Give it a try.\\n\\nRussell\\n\\n',\n",

The Jewish council you mentioned previously didn\\'t\\naccept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical\\nprecedence for their actions.

Ford hasn\\'t released a new\\ncar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been\\nbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those\\nmodular V8\\'s are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and\\ncompetition, don\\'t rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.\\nAnd there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,\\nwho really knows what it\\'ll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.\\nHighly.\\n\\nThe next Mustang will be Ford\\'s highest profile car.  It attracts\\nway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it\\'s heritage\\nis more embedded in the general public.  Don\\'t lie to yourself and\\nbelieve Ford will forfeit that.\\n\\nI submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit\\ndefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,\\nintelligent, critical spews like, \"The Mustang bites, man!\"  Some of\\nyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro\\nwill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the\\ndifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.\\nThe Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its\\ncab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still\\nreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to\\nthe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while\\nthe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.\\nBoth will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).

I think\\nit was also shown during the Calgary-LA game. \\n\\n(Warning... Anti-fighting people may want to skip this post.)\\n\\nTopics\\n------\\n\\nDon\\'s Tie, Doug Gilmour, Wings/Leafs, Quebec/Montreal, Boston/Buffalo,\\nWendel Clark, Fighting and Stickwork.\\n\\nEpisode Summary\\n---------------\\n\\nOnce again, the episode started with a shot of Don\\'s tie... This\\nwas a different tie than last time. Don pointed out some of the\\ncharacters on the tie, but gave them different names... Felix the\\nCat (Sylverster), Maclean (Daffy Duck), etc.\\n\\nRon Maclean asked Don what he thought of the current Wings-Leafs\\ngame. Don thought it was good. Burns told the Leaf players \"They\\nwon in their building, we\\'re going to win in ours\".\\n\\nDon then began to praise Gilmour again. Don pointed out that Gilmour\\nhas never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he\\ngot 5 points in a game against St. Louis.  (Don also claims that\\nhe gave a lot of encouragement to Gilmour, which was partly responsible\\nfor his good play.) Several clips were then shown of Gilmour\\nfrom the series... A hit on Constantinov, and a pass to Andrewchuk\\nresulting in a goal.\\n\\nOn the game itself, the Wings were taking a lot of penalties in\\nthe first period. The Wings have enough talent to score short handed\\nhowever, and when the Leafs get a power play, Coach Burns tells\\nthe Leaf players \"Don\\'t let them score on you\".\\n\\nRon brought up the previous Quebec-Montreal game. [Note: Montreal\\nwon that game in overtime, despite having a possible game winner\\ndisqualified because it was batted in with a high stick.] Don\\nthought the high stick was obvious, even without the use of\\ninstant replay.\\n\\nOn the Buffalo-Boston series [Note: Buffalo is currently winning\\nthe series 3-0], Don gave full credit to Goaltender Grant Fuhr.\\nFuhr should be getting 1/2 the team\\'s playoff checks for his\\nplay.\\n\\nWendel Clarke has recently been criticized for his performance\\nduring the Detroit-Toronto series. Don defended him, by saying\\nthat he can\\'t play the way he should, because of the league\\'s\\nnew rules. \"This used to be a rough and tough league... Now its\\nall hack and slash.\" Don lays the blame on Gil Stien for the\\nproblems.\\n\\nDon\\'s opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by Wings\\nGM and coach Bryan Murray. A clip from a news conference by Murray\\nwas shown, in which Murray made statements claiming the elimination\\nof fighting increases stickwork. Don also read a newspaper article\\nin which Murray makes the following statements: \"Players don\\'t fight\\nbecause they\\'re afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.\\nInstead, they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing\\neach other. Is this what the fans want to see? I guarantee there\\nwouldn\\'t be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.\"\\n\\nDon warned league commisioner Gary Bettman to \"smarten up\" with\\nfighting in hockey. He went on to say that before, there used\\nto be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. Now, with no fights,\\nsomeone gets cut every period.\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nTypical anti-fighting posturing, but here Don\\'s opinion is supported\\nby Murray.\\n\\nI\\'d give it a 7.0 out of 10.\\n',\n",

As I stated, religion\\n\\nThere are various contradictory views on the origin of the Armenians.\\nThe name is to be found in the Darian inscriptions in the form \\'Armina\\'\\nor \\'Aramaniya\\' is to be found in the inscription on the Bistun monument.\\nThe following references to the Armenians are to be found in the Bistun\\ncuneiform inscription of Dara Vishdasb (510 B.C.).\\n\\n 1. The monarch Dara said: I sent my servant to Arminam \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\n 6. On reaching Arminam \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\n 7. To the country town of Zozo, to Armaniya \\'Armeniya\\'.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian:\\n\\nAs for \\'Armenia\\', the equivalent of the \\'Armin\\' or \\'Arminik\\' of the Persians,\\nthis is more recent than the word \\'Ararat\\', and is to be found used in\\nthe Dara inscriptions for \\'Haiastan\\'.  \\n\\nSaint Martin:\\n\\nThe name \\'Armenie\\' has been given since very early times by almost all\\nthe various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the Armenians\\nas \\'Haiastan\\'. It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\'. \\'Ar\\' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.\\'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place-name, that \\'Armen\\' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word \\'Hai\\'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.\\'\\n\\nYensen, in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is\\nidentical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\', in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \\n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\\nfamily.\\n\\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\\n\\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \\n\\nInvestigations carried out by N. Kossovitch on the links between\\nArmenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics\\nled him to the conclusion that the Armenians did not form a \\ndistinct race.\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n',\n",

I was also\\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\\nBravo!\\n\\n(Note to IBM\\'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\\nthrough proper channels so I\\'m not giving away any new unpublished info.)\\n\\n-- \\n  Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]\\n  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems\\n  Austin TX\\n * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *\\n',\n",

The question, really, has to do with the\\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\\n\\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\\namong the Greeks.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\\n\\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God\\'s word to the Jews in\\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\\ncourse, Anglicans don\\'t do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it\\nwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the\\nHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which\\nled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.\\n\\nBTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of\\ntranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,\\nabove) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two\\nof four have been published so far.\\n-- \\nMichael L.

The following are quotes of his speech: \\n\\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \\nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \\nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \\nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \\narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \\nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \\nof Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \\nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \\nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \\nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \\nafter Kuwait itself.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \\nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \\nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \\nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \\nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq\\'s \\nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \\n\\n\\nOrigins of Kuwait \\n\\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \\nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \\nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \\nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait\\'s name is derived from al-Kut which means \\nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \\nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \\nestablishment. \\n\\nThe \\'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of \\'Utub, settled in Kuwait \\nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \\nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \\nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for \\'Utub. \\n\\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \\nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \\nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \\ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \\nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \\nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr\\'s chart \\nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \\ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \\n1750-1800. pub.1965. \\n\\nAl-Sabah (\\'Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \\nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima\\'s conclusions in his well \\ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \\nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \\nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \\nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \\nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \\ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha\\'s expedition against the \\nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \\nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \\nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of \\'Utbi external policy \\nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \\nGulf.\\'\\' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \\nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \\n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.\\'\\' (p.183) \\n\\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \\nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \\ntried to win the support of Kuwait\\'s Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \\nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \\nGulf area. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait \\n\\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \\nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \\nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \\nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \\n\\nAbdullah\\' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \\nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \\nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \\nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \\nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \\n\\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \\nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \\nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \\nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \\njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \\nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \\nwar against Su\\'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \\na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \\nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \\nthose who had signed it. \\n\\n\\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \\nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \\nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \\n\\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \\nUniversity, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \\n\\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \\nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \\n\\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \\nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \\nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa\\'immaqam [representative] on \\nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \\nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \\nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \\nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \\nterritory. \\n\\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \\nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \\nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \\nfather\\'s agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \\nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \\nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \\nentitled to receive. \\n\\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \\nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \\nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \\nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \\nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \\nhim the title of Qa\\'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \\nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \\nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \\nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \\nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \\nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \\nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh\\'s \\ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \\n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \\nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \\nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.\\'\\' \\n\\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \\nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \\nexplained above. However, Kuwait\\'s relations with the Ottoman \\nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \\ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \\npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \\nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \\nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \\nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \\nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \\nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,\\'\\' which had been \\nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.\\'\\' \\nThis description of Pelly\\'s reception indicates that to a certain \\ndegree it was run according to protocol. \\n\\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \\nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \\nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \\nCazee\\'s decision.\\'\\' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \\nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \\narmy.\\'\\' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \\ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \\n\\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \\nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \\nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \\nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \\nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \\nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \\nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.\\'\\' \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,\\'\\' but \\nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \\nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \\nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \\nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \\nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \\nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \\nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \\nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \\nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \\ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \\n\\nAfter Edmunds\\' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \\nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \\nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \\nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \\nTherefore, they considered that Jabir\\'s conduct did not indicate any \\nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \\n\\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \\nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \\nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as \\'Umar Ibn \\'Ufaisan, the \\nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \\nsought refuge in Kuwait. \\n\\nProtection of refugees seeking political \\nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \\nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \\nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait\\'s independence \\nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \\nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \\nneighbors. \\n\\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \\nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \\nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \\n\\nAs to Kuwait\\'s position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \\nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \\nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \\neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \\n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\\nshould be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\\n-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\n>\"...

And such were \\n>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\\n\\nThe moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\\nin this.  I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nHomosexual behavior is no different.  I (and the other gay Christians I\\nknow) are adamant in condemning rape -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and\\nchild molestation -- heterosexual or homosexual -- and even the possibly\\n\"harmless\" but obsessive kinds of sex -- heterosexual or homosexual --\\nthat would stand condemned by Paul in the very continuation of the chapter\\nyou cite [may I mildly suggest that what *Paul* does in his letter that\\nyou want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning?]\\n\\n\\t\"\\'I am free to do anything,\\' you say.  Yes, but not everything\\n\\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\\n\\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\\n\\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a secondary\\nargument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nI won\\'t deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\\n\\nI\\'m dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\nof the ritual law?\\n\\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\\n\\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\\n\\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\\nyou can think of to do so.\\n\\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\nWHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\ncondemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?

Dept. - New Mexico Tech\\nLines: 46\\nNntp-Posting-Host: baltic\\n\\n\\n\\tFor a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful\\nwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also\\npretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of\\nbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I\\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\\n\\n\\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So\\nI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly\\nand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually\\nfelt refreshed the next morning.\\n\\n\\tSo,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and\\nexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am\\npresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The\\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research\\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\\ndosage level to try.\\n\\n\\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)\\n\\n\\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of\\nantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use\\n(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by\\nmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be\\na serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,\\nwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have\\ntried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to\\nlower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some\\nkind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in\\nany other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried\\nmany of the non-pharmacological solutions)\\n\",\n",

These\\nreadouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM\\nyesterday, 4/29/93.

Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty complex, and Cd isn\\'t the whole story either.  Cd for cars is\\nusually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car\\nwith a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a\\npoorer Cd. \\n\\nTo calculate drag use this formula:\\n\\nD = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S\\n\\nWhere D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),\\nV is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the\\npieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure\\n(a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). \\n\\nNote that power is:\\n\\nP = F * v\\n\\nWhere P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v\\nis velocity (ft/s). \\n\\nNote that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for\\nforce) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That\\'s why huge increases in power\\nresult in little increases in speed.

Let\\'s consider some \"personal interpretations\"\\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\\n\\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\\n\\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\\n\\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\\nexamining McConkie\\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\\n\\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\\n\\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title \\'Elohim\\'...\" (Articles of Faith,\\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\\n\\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\\n\\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\\n\\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\\n\\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\\nMcConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\\n\\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\\n  Messianic prophecy?\\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\\n  David\\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\\n  unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The\\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\\n  sit on my right hand forever.\\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\\n\\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\\n\\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\\nwhich reads:\\n\\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"The same Psalm says: \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they\\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\\nthe Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\\n  Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\\n  As to the role of Judas in those conspiracies, the Psalmist says:\\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\\n  Messiah, p. 532)\\n\\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and\\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\\n\\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\\n\\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\\n\\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\\nwill be considered in this examination.\\n\\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\\n\\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\\' role in\\nChrist\\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\\n\\n        Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps.\\n        110:4.\\n\\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\\n  says: \"The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for\\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\\n  p. 450)\\n\\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\\n\\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\\n     (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\\nhim [Christ]...\"\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\\nverses.\\n\\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\\nthese Scriptures:\\n\\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\\n\\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\\n\\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\\nthe Messiah.\\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\\n\\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\\n\\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\\n\\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy. \"The\\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\\n\\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\\n\\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\\n\\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\\n\\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\\n\\n        Now, what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\\nScriptures prove this fact:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\\n\\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\\n  son...

(Joel 2:32)\\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\\n\\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\\n  22:12)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1\\n  Thess. 3:13)\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)\\n  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)\\n\\n  \"...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah].

(Heb. 10:15-17)\\n  (emphasis on \"Holy Ghost\" and \"said\" added)\\n  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a\\n  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...\\n  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;\\n  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people....

See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)\\n\\n        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that\\n\"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.\\n\\n  \"And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,\\n  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,\\n  Moses, Moses.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\\n\\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah\\'s\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\\n5:27)\\n\\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\\nBible reveals that \"Elohim\\'s\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\\n\\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...\\'Elohim,\\' is the literal Parent\\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\\n\\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\\nman\\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\\ntruth about who created man.\\n\\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\\n  him_.

If they are\\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit...

McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\\n  Abraham\\'s writings.

Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\\n\\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\\n\\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\\n\\n        Regarding the Mormon \\'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\\n\\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\\n\\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\\n\\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\\n\\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\\n  developed....\\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\\n  Father, and to him only....\\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\\n\\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\\n\\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\\n\\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\\n\\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\\n\\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\\n\\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\\n\\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\\n\\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\\n\\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\\n\\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\\nidolatry.\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\\n\\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\\n\\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\\n  (Josh. 23:7)\\n\\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\\n\\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\\n\\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\\n\\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\\n\\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\\n  24:15-16)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\\nand all therein.\\n\\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\\n\\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim\\'s\" covenant\\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim\\'s\" of\\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\\n\\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\\n\\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\\nworld to redeem mankind.\\n\\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\\n\"Jehovah.\"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons\\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\\n\\n        In answer to Jesus\\' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\\n\\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\\n\\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\\n1)\\n\\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\\nThe Bible says:\\n\\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\\n\\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\\n\\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\\n\\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\\n17:3)\\n\\n  \"...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you.\" (Ju. 2:3. See also\\n  Exod. 23:32-33)\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Message-digest algorithms\\nhave many applications, including digital signatures and message\\nauthentication.\\n\\nRSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\\nRivest \\\\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\\nComputing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\\nsecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\\\em proved}\\nsecure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\\nto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\\noperations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\\none has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\\n\\nRecent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\\\cite{den-boer-md5} presents\\na special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\\ninternal compression function, which maps\\na 512-bit message block $x$ and a\\n128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\\nstate. They show how to find a message block $x$\\nand two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\\noutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\\nexploits structural properties of the collision function to find \\na pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\\nwould expect.\\n\\nPractical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\\nMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\\npseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\\npseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\\ncollision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\\nalways involve {\\\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\\n$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\\nmessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\\ngenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\\nthe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\\nextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\\nspecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\\n\\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\\nBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\\nMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\\nand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\\ncourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\\nother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\\nsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\\n\\n\\\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\n\\\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\\nBert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\\n\\\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\\n\\\\newblock In {\\\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\\n\\\\newblock Preprint.\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{rfc-md5}\\nR.L.

I\\'d like to give some feedback based on\\nreal life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode\\nand it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does\\nis when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes\\nsense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different\\ndirections.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its\\nreporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.\\n\\nI have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case\\nthere was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I\\npassed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then\\nthe detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With\\nother radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection.\\nBut with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there\\nwas another trap.  And there was!\\n\\nOn other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from\\na true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator\\nchanges.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where\\nthe signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the \\nplace.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector\\nthat leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the\\ncar passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would\\nhave been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar\\ntrap when there was none.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features\\nto be useful and not gimmicks.\\n\\n                                       -Barry\\n-- \\n-----                                                                   --------\\nBarry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com\\nChelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319\\nChelmsford, MA                                                 \\n',\n",

The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire\\'s breakout. \\nUnfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits \\nrequired approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally \\nout to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local \\ncommunity volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By \\nthe time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame \\nand it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers \\nand no water supply. The FBI made another call requesting a tank truck, \\nbut the Waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not \\nhave one. Though clearly unwilling to risk firemen\\'s lives in the \\nline of fire, it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient \\nequipment and water to make a difference.\\n\\nThey even aired a tape of a woman who called Waco 911 from Georgia \\nasking if anything was being done. Civic-minded, but probably \\nirresponsible; if everyone watching television did that, no local \\ncalls could get through.\\n\\nABC also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who \\nviewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the \\nstandard \"pool shot\"), and agreed that the fire a) must have been \\nstarted in at least 3 places, and b) must have had an accelerant \\nto spread so fast.\\n\\nNeither of these is conclusive proof that the Koresh crowd offed \\nthemselves more than the FBI offed them, but it\\'s a heck of a lot \\nstronger proof than some of the \"theories\" floating around the net.\\n\\nScore 2 FBI, 0 Branch Davidians.

Don\\'t tell me you don\\'t worship\\nOsiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson\\'s\\nEgyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British\\nMasonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black\\nmason.  I\\'ve talked with him, though much he likes to hide (\"mystery\"). \\nSpecial handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to \"evangelize\" me,\\nhe told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a\\n\"mystery\" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and\\nchildrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest\\ndegree mason every learns of.\\n>\\n>     Second, worship of Osiris is not, nor has it ever been, a part of\\n>Masonic practice (we are strictly non-denominational).\\n>\\nI haven\\'t read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired\\napologist (can\\'t remember his name) on TV, didn\\'t exactly come to this same\\nconclusion.  \\n\\n\"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally\\nrepresented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented\\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\\n-i.e. as a child in his mother\\'s arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\\nrepented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!)\\n\\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\\nMasonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally\\ntalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating\\nyourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?\\n\\n-Rex\\n',\n",

If the investigation indicates a\\n   likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God,\\n   it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the\\n   Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to\\n   believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the\\n   authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved\\n   private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I\\n   suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but\\n   if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not\\n   orthodox Catholics in good standing.)\\n\\nIt may be a bit much to say that a Catholic is free to deny what\\nhappened at Fatima.  That\\'s a bit strong, it is sort of like saying\\nthat a Catholic is free to deny that Hong Kong exists.  What a\\nCatholic *is* free to do is to deny the truth of Fatima, without being\\ncalled a heretic.  You can be labeled other things for such an\\noffense, but not a heretic.\\n\\nTheologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent\\none must give to events like Fatima and Lourdes.  Things revealed by\\nGod through Jesus Christ or His Apostles must be given the assent due\\nto a revelation of God: total and unswerving.  Fatima and Lourdes\\ndemand our assent as much as any other well-attested event in human\\nhistory.  Perhaps a bit more, given the approval of the Church.\\n\\n\"Approval\" of an apparition by the Church principally means that\\nwhatever happened was in harmony with the Catholic Faith.\\n\\nI personally think of private revelations as our Lord\\'s way of telling\\nus what to do at particular periods in history.  He gave us all the\\ndoctrines, etc., 2000 years ago, but we can always use some help in\\nknowing how exactly to apply what He gave us.\\n\\nCatholic devotion to the Sacred Heart was a result of a series of\\napparitions to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque, for example.  The problem\\nat the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our Lord into\\nsomeone without a heart.\\n\\nThe Fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the\\nChurch (we are living it), and what to do to save the most souls\\npossible in such a situation.\\n',\n",

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it\\nis probably worth reading, if only so that you\\'ll know what all the fuss is\\nabout.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

Some studies suggest \\nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \\nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \\nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\\n\\n> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?\\n> How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

But many viruses \\nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \\nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \\nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\\n\\n> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\\n> term effects?\\n\\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \\nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \\nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \\nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \\nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\\n \\n> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\\n> normal, and what does one do about it?\\n\\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \\nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \\nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \\ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \\nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \\nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \\nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \\nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \\nassociated with the infection.\\n\\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\\n\\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \\nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \\nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \\nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \\nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \\nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \\ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \\nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \\ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \\nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \\nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \\nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \\nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I\\'ve worked up so far.\\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \\ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \\nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \\nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that\\'s \\nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \\nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \\nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good \\nfor getting general dietary advice from however.\\n\\n> Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much\\n> appreciated.

The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
